#It's been busy.

So, I am doing alright now. but a lot of stuffs going on those days and **i will write a long post util I became "idle" again** i promise.

As you can see, in this blog's left panel, there's a [new link][1] called [Blog for coding][1]. and it's my new blog for codes. I started it from October, 2013.Mostly, i did that blog for codes is because i want to keep a track of what i learn and what i've made during the process of coding.

It could be good for me. and it looks AWESOME with a cool domain:)

If you are interested in my code, go to my [Blog for coding][1]

If you are insterested in me or my life, you can stay here as long as you want, This server will keep up and running for you\^\^
