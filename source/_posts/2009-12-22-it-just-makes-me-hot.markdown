Department Overview ("The area"): 
  
Google's software engineers develop the next-generation
technologies for which we've become world-renowned. In addition to
revolutionizing search technology, we use our world-class programming
skills to innovate in a number of other areas as well. Our projects
include working on advanced information-retrieval algorithms, massive
scalability and storage solutions, and large-scale applications that
enrich the user experience. We also work extensively on networking
systems, advertising systems and complex transaction systems in
consumer applications.   

  
Job Description ("The role"): 
  
  Software Engineers have a passion for solving complex and interesting problems. 
  
Google is much more than search, and our mission has much greater
scope. To handle information at the scale of the web requires ideas
from just about every area of computer science, including information
retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security,
data compression, user interface design, etc.
  

  
Engineers work on many projects that carry varying
responsibilities. Below are some examples of the diverse projects with
which you might be involved.
  

  
Responsibilities: 
  
1.Write server-side code for web-based applications, create robust
high-volume production applications, and develop prototypes quickly.
You should also have a strong understanding of, and practical
experience with, Java web application development.
  
2.Build our platforms, systems and networking infrastructure
using your strong background in distributed systems, OS/kernel, network
system design, and large scale storage systems.
  
3.Build internal systems used by thousands of Googlers around the
world with your domain expertise in HR, Staffing, Legal, and all other
corporate functions.
  
4.Specialist domains: UI development with AJAX and similar
technologies, client application development for Windows/Mac (Chrome,
Toolbar, etc.), embedded systems and mobile apps (Android), developer
tools (IDEs, large-scale build systems, compilers),
internationalization.
  

  
Requirements: 
  
  1.BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or related technical discipline (or equivalent).
  
  2.A solid foundation in computer science, with strong competencies in data structures, algorithms, and software design.
  
  3.Extensive programming experience in C/C++ and/or Java (strong OO skills preferred).
  
  4.Several years of large systems software design and development experience, with extensive knowledge of Unix/Linux.
  
5.Coding skills in Python or Javascript/AJAX, database design and
SQL, and/or knowledge of TCP/IP and network programming are a plus.
  
  6.Fluency in English (reading and writing).  
  
Hopefully...
