Hi, yeah, finally I caught a break to write something to share with you guys. It's been an amazing times here in Hangzhou, it's too busy to write, but I couldn't wait to share with you.

Hmm, but right now, I do not even know where to start, so, just keep reading.

Let's talk about my work first, going to work and getting paid is one of my biggest change happened to me lately, I sometimes don't even realised that i am no longer a student anymore:)

I've been assigned to a new team that I found that it's much more interesting and challenging than the previous one, consequently, I am feeling more motivated. It's quite a new field for me, but I am getting better at it. I get the feeling that the product I am making right now, could be something that I will be proud of.

Besides of my work, i am also doing well with my love life. She loves me and cares for me. I just had my very first Valentine's day with her last week, that was just awesome! I flew to Kunming, a city near her hometown. Then we had some famous food of Yunnan. Another main event is that we've gone to a famous lake with a great hotel. Such a day!

So, I am having a really good time here in Hangzhou and I wish to have some more to share with you.
