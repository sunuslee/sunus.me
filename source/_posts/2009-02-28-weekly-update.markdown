all right,Here I am.  
technically,I finished it in several days ago and kept on my laptop.now,it's time to post.  
by the way,due to the situation where i was in before,maybe it's different from what it's now.Or it would have remained the same until several minutes before i got i new message.  
btw#2:  
i am going to watch some movies now,so i just post what i have wrote before.If you want a new one,which is also interesting and complicated,just keep clicking the REFRESH button.It could be jump out any time:)  
  
  
  
﻿Those things should be blogged,Though,its kinda complicated.  Well,a
tough week is gone,put that exams,which isn't the point i wanna
do on my blog,aside . So,here comes the thing.A couple of weeks late,a
friendship that i thought would be long locked and remained in my mind
and hers -maybe- was BACK. It happened suddenly,even without a single
sign! So,on that very last vacation,we did have had a great time,which
i didn't expect at all. Life isn't suck all time,but sometimes,life is
changeable and make people screw things up. When we back to school on
the second time,Both of we were much relaxed than the first time ,which
with chocolates giving and teachers keeping us company: ) .its good. I
didn't even think about how to cope this relationship. The very
sensitive period that those a few days after back to school came
again.I don't think i can fully take the fact that watching she and her
male friend hanging out together. I asked myself "from scale one to
ten,how uncomfortable you were?" i picked 6 or 7,somehow.Then,a word
popped out,its JEALOUS! Am i jealous of her friends? I don't
know,anyway,i cannot chase any girl right now.who cares whomever she
hangs out with? I do,without a significant reason.Complicated as it
is,i am going to figure that out.If i cannot handle this well.The
friendship that i care about may go,again. Also,the feelings that being
told about her friends''s stuff didn't sweet at all,which i often did
that to others.So,i will try to avoid that happening. Finally,the
gay-friends statement turned out to be useless.What the hell is
so-called gayfriends relationship that beyond friendship. I just hope
that i wont get screwed up this time.I do care about you,but,how am i
suppose to do?  
  
  
maybe,something comes around:):)
