Good morning to you all:)

I've been back to university for some days, and i just had a really great fun in Happy-Valley in Tianjin with my new friend:) 

I'm always enthusiasm about for stuffs like Happy-Valley since I was a kid. When I started my university here, I've been to Beijing's Happy-Valley for some times. That was fun! Now, I __finally__ had a chance to go to Tianjin's Happy-Valley, which I dreaming for some time:) I really mean it, so thank you, my friend came with me to this wonderful & exciting place.

So, we had a great hot-pot in one of my favorite restaurants then went to the hotel the other night. That hotel is great with a giant lobby.

Thanks to me to pick this hotel which is only a few steps away from the Happy-Valley.

Then, the adventure began. We almost played all the stuffs except those that are suspended due to some maintaining reasons.

The roller coasters, haunted houses, etc.. That were so exciting which I haven't experienced for some years and now, I am feeling that again, just like a teenager:) Finally, I got wetted.

I am just feeling I am still younger and energetic:) and thank you, my new friends for spending your time with me. That's a fantastic experience.
