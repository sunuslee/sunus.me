**"With great power comes great** responsibility."  
  
I found and wrote it.As my Birthday gift for myself.yeah,now i have been turned 18.  
On that day,26th of March,my Dad called me,said   
"hey,soon.you are an adult now,how's feeling? "  
"so-so,not bad.and..."  
"eventually,you became a grown,from this moment forwards,you can be a President if you have that ability"  
"hehe haha..."  
......  
  
let's turn to March 30th, I had dinner,sitting on computer,wrote something i feeling that makes me .....  
During the dinner,I felt great responsibility on my shoulder.There's no doubt I will go towards my goal.  
but can i?i don't know.The real situation i meet was not good enough,rather than so-so.Although that,i will not give up,whatever how much times i fail.I am the man who never swerves from his determination to success.To manage this,i have a loooooooooong way to go.

With my emotion world going down and down,my mind became stronger and stronger.I realized that no good female would put herself into a bad guy.So,just keep going,There must be a beauty wating for you,Despite when of where.It's must exsitting.

Enjoy my grown time!Make it Big and Brilliant  
  
Done.
