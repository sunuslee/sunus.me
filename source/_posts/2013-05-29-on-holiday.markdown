Hey, Long time no see. i have been on holiday for about a week and we'll get back to Tianjin in a few days later.

We'd been to **Nanjing**, **Suzhou** and we just got to the last destination, that's, **Hangzhou**.

I guess i still can not move on that quickly, Overall, the holiday is fun and interesting. but, **I just wish you were here**, to see the beautiful views and having the yummy & delicious local foods.
and also, take some of the stupid & funny pictures like this:
