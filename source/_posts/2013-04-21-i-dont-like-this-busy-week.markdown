hi, it's been a while:) i just had some busy weeks and finally, i think i can take a break now. i can spend more time with friends and my personal work, plus some go on dates, if i am **luckily** enough.
 
i had been playing multiply roles for some weeks.

### System Administrator
  * Since the data on our servers got destroyed by mistake, i have to do that form scratch and got some new problems, mostly because we now work at a new lab with different networking enviroment.  it took some extra work. and also i have to re-write and setup our team wiki pages. i think that wiki is important but some of the guys in the team didn't think that way, fine. now i can say that with confident that i am fully qualified for a **SA** position:)

### HR guy
  * All right, it's not that **official**, but i do have some rights at this team right now, and i did have received some resumes and **hire** someone to do stuffs with us, LOL. hoping i hired the right guy. and i am still want people to work with us, see the recruiting ad here: An [PDF version](http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf, 'download os-recuriting.pdf'), [HTML version](http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo)
  * i am waiting, join us soon:)

### _Talker_
  * I don't know what the fuck the _talker_ is ? but i can explain what that is, i talked with some of the main members our this team, asked their thougths on this **thing** we are doing right now, what're they thinking and what they want to do next. and their answer is just, let's say, simple.
  * I used to have pretty high admire on them, and i used to think i can count on them. but right now, i think i have to re-consider those thoughts. obviously they have other pressing matters right now, i have no comment on this and i have no right to judge them. but, i have mine too, and it's the main reason why i came back this year. it's definitely **NOT** what we do right now. if you don't have motivation or this s not interested to you any more, you can quit. because at this point, i just find out every one right now are replaceable, i can not see the quality/ability we need in you right now, but, i once think you have those.
  
### Secretary
  * Yes, secretary. I wrote a lot those days and i knew what i know my writing skills sucks. glad i have some guy to help me. final, i finished those crap, I can not believe some parts of those paper are written by me.
  * besides writing papers, I went around, hand in papers to different people, get their signature. even printed the paper.
  * A teacher call me everyday around 9 am to wake up and go to he office, to write.
  
### Team Leader
  * i don't like this title, but i did have those title in some document files. since i talked to the guys in the team, i have to think and assigned tasks about we need to do at this point and future as well to them, based on their skills, attitute and motivation. i think i am doing ok, hoping they will do the same:)

### Developer
  * yeah, that's what i love most, luckily i found i need some simple but basic feature/service but it didn't exist. so i write a script to get it done and i am using it on a daily basis. of course i open source of this project.
  * [The Backup-Box](https://github.com/sunuslee/bub) it can sync/backup you files using the services provided by stuffs like dropbox, google drive, amazon cloud but offers a feature that allowed you to select any files on your machine and get it backed up, **you don't have to manually put those files into the directory in the cloud drive**
  * yesterday i found the first version code of hub looks ugly and seems confuse, so i rewrite most of them, it now looks much like my code:)
  * i start to take license seriously, so i chose _MIT Open Source License_ to publish bub. 

### Student
  * i went to a Linux class in school, but i ran off in less than ten minutes.because i don't find any nice girl in the classroom.
  * kidding, i got other stuff to take care of at that time.
  * kidding, again. if there is nice girl in the classroom, that 'other stuff' can certainly wait another hour:)
  
## Some other stuffs
 * i am glad i still stay in the campus and did't want to **quit** again. this is a quit week and i don't really enjoy this kind of busy, it's not what i want. i just want to do **my thing** and get it done perfectly.
 * i don't even got time to swim, but i got time to swim and writing blog today, it feels great. i am making progress in the pool.
 * i watched a great movie called [_waiting alone_](http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/) , i found it just like a mirror to me and i just found my **Liu Rong** in my life, or maybe i knew it for quite a while but afraid to admit it? god, i wish i can watch this movie earlier.
 * i will watch another great movie _Django Unchained_ this week. i should watch it earlier but just too busy this week, now that i got time, i will watch it.

## Something is missing ?
nope:)
good night and wish me luck.
