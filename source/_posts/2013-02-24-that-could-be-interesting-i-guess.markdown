** Long time no see **

* Hi, there! First of all, happy new year to you and wish you all have a wonderful new year, i give you my very best wishes here:)
Yeah, i did quit my job last year and had theses about 40 days of **AWESOME** holidays in my hometown with my family and friends which is fun and happy. We went to couple of places with views, of course, i took some photos, too. But most of those photos are mountains and some kind of **vulgar** pictures. LOL

* Besides of having fun, i got my MacBook, it's a whole new user experiences, which i can not tell it's better that Linux or not. but compare to Windows. it's definitely a piece of work. Windows sucks, i said it to all the people i care about! :) I am getting used to OS X and i think it's more comfortable to develop some **app** on that machine than my old laptop. But it's okay, i do Linux-related/python work on my old machine while i am also a newcomer of APP developing. i am getting my motivations back, it just feel much better that i want to and CAN code again!

* Tomorrow i will fly back to school and i don't know what that is, i am leading some students to launch a **OpenStack** project in school, even though i don't think that will be too much difficult for me, given the current situation we have. but still, i will do the most major work. don't know it's good for me or not, just wait and see how it goes. Also, i want some nice **girls** who's interested in front-end to help me, i don't know if she exists in my school.

* Finally, the same-old-boring topic, i can not stop thinking about her, i know she also had a great great time on holiday, she sure did! so, let's just hope she is still available. I even pray for that in a old temple. kidding! i didn't do that:) so, still, chances are slim but i still don't want to give up on this girl who had stolen my heart for months, in some point stolen my codes as well:< hoping i can make this right. We didn't send a word to each other in this whole holiday and i am not sure if she still remember me or not. but, i had hard time picking gifts for her and lucky(or not?) enough, i got something gift picking advice from my friends and sisters. so, just wait and see if she like that or not.

* I am Back and I miss you all! the new semester could be a interesting one, not because of the school or class but you and all the uncertain changes and opportunity i wanted for a while!!
