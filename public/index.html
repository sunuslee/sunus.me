<p>因为ungetc的原因，代码请用gcc编译vc/vs对ungetc的处理不很好。</p>

<p>fo2_bug就是2b的字符串反转函数,把字符串ins反转之后存到outs.在main调用fo2_bug之后。会有点异想不到的事情花生～～</p>

<p>有同学说说fo2_bug这个函数的bug在哪儿，bug的症状是啥，为什么会出现bug&#8230;怎么fix就随便吧，太轻松了～</p>

<p>答对的女同学我请吃饭吧..</p>

<p>男同学，嗯。。送一个月高速PROXY或者迅雷会员吧&#8230;.<sup>^</sup></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hi, there.
yeah, i am gonna turn 0x17 tomorrow, that&#8217;s another whole new year for me and i think i just end my time in 0x16.
after reading my last year&#8217;s post, the theme of my 0x16 is &#8216;trying hard to be a guy that deserves you&#8217; , i think i failed, but i will continue to do so in my upcoming 0x17 times :)</p>

<p><strong>I failed to win her heart :&lt;</strong></p>

<p>but anyway, my 0x16 times turned out to be good. i got a nice job in the early year, i learned a lot from those awesome guys i met in the dev team and i gained a lot, i wish to be as good as them in the beginning. but in the end, i got acknowledged by them. it&#8217;s not easy, but it&#8217;s quite a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong>I really enjoyed thoses times in beijing, writing codes and getting paid and having tons of fun with new friends</strong></p>

<p>then, i quit that job and got back to school, plan to having some normal college student&#8217;s life. that&#8217;s, mostly a serious relationship with someone i like.</p>

<p><strong>I need some motivation to be excellent againn</strong></p>

<p>Also, this year, the main reason of me quitting the job and getting back to schol is, i really really want some <em>changes</em>, though i don&#8217;t know what that is, but it will come eventually, right?</p>

<p><strong>I already made some of those, namely from user-friendly linux distribution to a more flexible one, from linux to OS X, from vim to emacs, etc</strong></p>

<p>I think this year will be awesome, and i&#8217;d love to take all the challenges and opportunity in the upcoming days.</p>

<p><strong>i will do more sports!</strong></p>

<p><strong>happy birthday and good luck for whatever that is.</strong></p>

<p>END OF 0x16.</p>

<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/sunuslee/5179422">https://gist.github.com/sunuslee/5179422</a></li>
<li>you probobly need to modify this file a little bit, or just create your own with <code>iptables-save &gt; filename</code></li>
<li>make sure you have <strong>PPP0-IP</strong> in that file. because this script will replace <strong>PPP0-IP</strong> with the real <strong>PPP0-IP</strong> address.</li>
<li>you need to put the file working-iptables-rules along with setroute.sh, in the same directory.</li>
<li>if you are interested, those lines contain |sunus-a/b/c/d| are the Log, demonstration of how the packets went through all the way from one end to another.</li>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>First of all, it all because my MacBookPro&#8217;s xl2tp utils can not work under my school&#8217;s networking enviroment. so this is how the post is born.</p>

<p>I have been digging with those stuffs for almost a week, and now, finally i get it rolling and it seems awesome. this post will talks about netfilter known as iptables and ip route policy. and some technic/tool like tcpdump will be involved as well.</p>

<h1>Environment</h1>

<p>The environment i have is like this below:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------    -----------------
| Slow          |    | Fast          |
| Internet-1    |    | Internet-2    |
| 10.10.149.1   |    | 123.150.232.1 |
-----------------    -----------------
         |             |
[eth0.2] |             |[ppp0]
         |             |
        --------------------------
        | Route, Running Linux   |
        | br-lan: 192.168.1.1    | [br-lan]      ------------------------
        | ppp0:   123.150.232.74 | --------------| Other Machines in Lan|
        | eth0.2: 10.10.149.4    |               ------------------------
        --------------------------
        |                        |
[br-lan]|                        |[br-lan]
        |                        |
        |                        |
        |                        |
  -------------------------      ----------------------
  |ArchLinux              |      | MacBook            |
  |eth0: 192.168.1.245    |      | en0:192.168.1.169  |
  |ppp0: 180.134.135.173  |      |                    |
  -------------------------      ----------------------
        |
        |
        |
        |
  ------------------
  | Fast           |
  | Internet-3     |
  | 180.134.135.1  |
  ------------------
</code></pre>

<p>   after connect the wires. there is three <strong> physic wires </strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong>Slow Internet-1 </strong>this is the only one that connects to outside my dorm. via route&#8217;s port WAN.</li>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong> ArchLinux </strong> this one is in a Route&#8217;s port #1 LAN</li>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong> MacBook </strong> same as above, using Route&#8217;s port #2 LAN</li>
</ul>


<p>  There is also something to be noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <strong>ppp0</strong> in <strong>Route</strong> is a high-speed connection(VPN). it needs to go though <strong>eth0.2</strong> to connect the VPN-server, then it will generate a Virtual Network InterFace, that is, ppp0.</p></li>
<li><p>the another <strong>ppp0</strong> in <strong>ArchLinux</strong> is also the high-speed connection. but firstly, it goes to <strong>Route</strong>, then the VPN-server.</p></li>
<li><p>in this environment, you can consider those ppp0 as real NICs that are connected to the internet as well.</p></li>
<li><p>So, we can say eth0.2 and two ppp0 are all outgoing Interfaces.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Solutions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>   I repeat what i want to accomplished here:</p>

<p>   1 .    i want my MacBook can connected to the internet.</p>

<p>   2 .    i want my MacBook&#8217;s internet connection to be as <strong>FAST</strong> as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>   Before we get started, there&#8217;s something we can do and can&#8217;t do, in general.</p>

<p>   1 .    Seting the <strong>default route</strong> to 180.134.135.1 for ArchLinux and a route to lan. We do this because we want all the trafftic goes to a fast internet connecting while we keep the connection to the other machines in the lan still work.</p>

<pre><code># route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
# route add default gw 180.134.135.1 dev ppp0
</code></pre>

<p>   2 .    Because there is other machines in the lan, so we can not set 123.150.232.1 as <strong>default route</strong> for Route, just like the ArchLinux. there is only <strong> me </strong> can access the Fast Internet-2.( The <strong>Benefit</strong> of being me or with me :) lol! )</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The Slow Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   Making the MacBook can connect to the internet, but it just too slow for me. Just set up machines and route like the diagram above, it will result this:</p>

<p>   1 .  the ArchLinux using Internet-3.</p>

<p>   2 .  the MacBookPro using Slow-Internet-1</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The A Little Bit Faster Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   Making the MacBook Using ArchLinux&#8217;s Internet-3 and the ArchLinux still keep unchanged in Slow Solution. This solution requires those steps.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>  in the MacBook, change default route from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.245</p>

<p> In MacBook:
 # route add default 192.168.1.245
 # route del default 192.168.1.1</p></li>
<li><p>  in ArchLinux, set up a route policy/rule</p>

<ul>
<li><p>  the packets that comes from MacBook(192.168.1.169), Using the gateway of Internet-3.</p>

<pre><code>In ArchLinux:
# add a empty table to route table
echo '7375 SunusRules' &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
# add a default route rule to newly create table SunusRules
ip route add default via 180.134.135.173 dev ppp0 table SunusRules
# add this table to routing rules, all the packet comes from MacBook, apply this route rule.
ip rule add from 192.168.1.169 table SunusRules
</code></pre></li>
<li><p> We are done here.</p></li>
<li><p> In fact, i don&#8217;t think add a route rule here is necessarily, but anyway, it&#8217;s a good time to get the first impression of what this can do. which we will make the best use of it in next Solution.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Ultimate And More Fast Solution, so far</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   As you may think, why we still didn&#8217;t use Fast-Internet-2 yet. Now, it&#8217;s time to rolling on this connection! Let the MacBook and only MacBook use this connection.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> In fact, this is a kinda complicated process, we need to do the following stuffs to put it all together to work properly.</p>

<p> 1 . Leave MacBook&#8217;s default (192.168.1.1) untouched.</p>

<p> 2 . Let the Route know, if a packet is come from MacBook(192.168.1.169), sets the <strong>Gateway</strong> of this connection to 1123.150.232.1 and <strong>Outgoing Interface</strong> to ppp0. because at this point, only ppp0 can connect to it&#8217;s <strong>Gateway</strong>(123.150.232.1)</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>policy routing</strong> is the first magic.

<ul>
<li>as most of us might already knew that, the linux kernel only allow exactly one <strong>efficient default</strong> in <strong>route table</strong>.</li>
<li>so this needs is beyond a simple <code>route</code> command can do. but, don&#8217;t worry. net-tools is out of date for so long, let us introduce the new <code>ip</code> tools to do this for us.</li>
<li>basically, this is still maintain that one kernel default route in route table, but, it allow us to add custom route table based on our needs, and set up the right condition. e.g <strong>the packet&#8217;s source address/net</strong> or <strong>the incoming interface</strong>, etc see <code>ip route help</code>.

<ul>
<li><p>the steps to make this happened are:</p>

<pre><code># add a table id and table name to the route table database, just make sure they are unique.
echo '7375 sunusroute' &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
# check if that succeeded, the out should be empty.
ip route show table sunusroute
# then, add route rules to this newly create table.
# set the default route/gateway of this table
ip route add default via 123.150.232.1 dev ppp0
# finally, add a rule to tell the kernel, under what circumstance,
the packet should use the route table from what we just set,
instead of the default route rules. we just set this simple rule, if a packet is from 192.168.1.169, then apply the rules in route table sunusroute.
ip rule add from 192.168.1.169 table sunusroute
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>check if those are valid by:</p>

<pre><code>ip rule show
&gt;&gt; 0: from all lookup local
&gt;&gt; 32761: from 192.168.1.169 lookup sunusroute
&gt;&gt; many-more-lines-of-other-rules
ip route show table sunusroute
&gt;&gt; default via 123.150.108.1 dev ppp0
ip route flush cache
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the last command <code>ip route flush cache</code> is just a precaution, in case the old rules in cache might do something nasty.</p></li>
<li><p>we are done in this step.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> 3 . Also, Since the Route&#8217;s default gateway isn&#8217;t 123.150.232.1, so it&#8217;s a must to set packet&#8217;s <strong>source address</strong> to 123.150.232.74. so here we will do a <strong>SNAT</strong> magic.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we are officially meet the iptables here, the firewall of the linux, a great tool for many other usages as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>the iptables consists by some tables, and those tables has some chains. the packet need to go all the way from the very first chain to the very last one. so that this packet can be send/receive correctly. during the packet&#8217;s travel in those tables and chains, it might be modify, accept, drop or reject, we can even add marks to those packets so that we can debug them.</li>
<li>here is a brief image of how a packets goes.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/iptables_traverse.jpg" title="iptables_traverse" alt="iptables packetes traversal path" /></p>

<ul>
<li>obviously, what we want the route to do is:</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>forward the packets from 192.168.1.169 to interface ppp0 with the right gateway 123.150.231.1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>follow the diagram, the packets should go through the tables and chains in the order of</p>

<ol>
<li>[packet come in from ppp0]</li>
<li>[raw-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[mangle-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[filter-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[ROUTING-DESICION]</li>
<li>[mangle-FORWARD]</li>
<li>[filter-FORWARD]</li>
<li>[ROUTING-DESICION]</li>
<li>[mangle-POSTROUTING]</li>
<li>[nat-POSTROUTING]</li>
<li>[packet come out from ppp0]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>I once not sure/doubt about what those <strong>ROUTING-DESICION</strong> do, after my research, i think it&#8217;s just decide what <strong>route</strong> to use, basically, it just look up the routing table and get a <strong>route</strong> to use.</p></li>
<li><p>so, what we need to do is, change the packets&#8217;s source address right after the packet go off. that is, in the step ten.</p>

<p> <code>iptables -t nat -o ppp0 -j SNAT --to-address 123.150.232.74</code></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> 4 . We&#8217;re pretty much done here:)</p>

<p> 5 . Enjoy!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<p><strong> Long time no see </strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hi, there! First of all, happy new year to you and wish you all have a wonderful new year, i give you my very best wishes here:)
Yeah, i did quit my job last year and had theses about 40 days of <strong>AWESOME</strong> holidays in my hometown with my family and friends which is fun and happy. We went to couple of places with views, of course, i took some photos, too. But most of those photos are mountains and some kind of <strong>vulgar</strong> pictures. LOL</p></li>
<li><p>Besides of having fun, i got my MacBook, it&#8217;s a whole new user experiences, which i can not tell it&#8217;s better that Linux or not. but compare to Windows. it&#8217;s definitely a piece of work. Windows sucks, i said it to all the people i care about! :) I am getting used to OS X and i think it&#8217;s more comfortable to develop some <strong>app</strong> on that machine than my old laptop. But it&#8217;s okay, i do Linux-related/python work on my old machine while i am also a newcomer of APP developing. i am getting my motivations back, it just feel much better that i want to and CAN code again!</p></li>
<li><p>Tomorrow i will fly back to school and i don&#8217;t know what that is, i am leading some students to launch a <strong>OpenStack</strong> project in school, even though i don&#8217;t think that will be too much difficult for me, given the current situation we have. but still, i will do the most major work. don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s good for me or not, just wait and see how it goes. Also, i want some nice <strong>girls</strong> who&#8217;s interested in front-end to help me, i don&#8217;t know if she exists in my school.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the same-old-boring topic, i can not stop thinking about her, i know she also had a great great time on holiday, she sure did! so, let&#8217;s just hope she is still available. I even pray for that in a old temple. kidding! i didn&#8217;t do that:) so, still, chances are slim but i still don&#8217;t want to give up on this girl who had stolen my heart for months, in some point stolen my codes as well:&lt; hoping i can make this right. We didn&#8217;t send a word to each other in this whole holiday and i am not sure if she still remember me or not. but, i had hard time picking gifts for her and lucky(or not?) enough, i got something gift picking advice from my friends and sisters. so, just wait and see if she like that or not.</p></li>
<li><p>I am Back and I miss you all! the new semester could be a interesting one, not because of the school or class but you and all the uncertain changes and opportunity i wanted for a while!!</p></li>
</ul>

		<h4>Making Changes</h4>

<p>Yes, i am writing this blog using <strong>EMACS</strong>, the ultimate text editor, i am so umfamiliar with it right now, but, i am getting better:)</p>

<p>A lot stuffs going on lately, i&#8217;ve been weighed the pros and cons about some certain things for quite a long time.
But now, I don&#8217;t think i will <strong>LOST</strong> again, because i believe i made the right decision, just like the one i made in 2010.
With no regrets but only excitement. I know this will become all new to me, since i regain my love for this university, which i&#8217;ve called it CRAPLAND for so long. I am really looking forward to what is happening next, i bet you will, too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Career</p>

<p>  The first and foremost one is about my intern, or i&#8217;d prefer to called it <strong>career</strong> :)</p>

<p>  I decided to <strong>quit</strong>, if school not kick me out right now.</p>

<p>  I love my development team, my leader and brothers. yeah, we&#8217;ve became really really close friends!</p>

<p>  I love what i do and what i will do if i remain stay there, that&#8217;s something i wish i could get hands on in a year ago, and i finally get the chance to play with it. the Amazing linux kernel, filesystem, and Networking stuffs.
And i will definitely take that offer if i got it six month ago, i wanted to write some serious code back then, besides the payment is good.</p>

<p>  but, everything has a beginning has an end, that&#8217;s how things work and i can only accept it. Since, i am no longer the guy i was six month ago, i am <strong>less</strong> motivated, but i will change.</p>

<p>  That change will not happen if i stay in company, or Beijing. and a <strong>push</strong> just came in time, letting me easier to make the call.</p>

<p>  So, here i am, back to Tianjin and hopefully i can pull myself together soon.</p>

<p>  And, I am gonna thank those guy who along the way with me, helping me making the decisions, thank you!</p></li>
<li><p>Myself</p>

<p>  I wanted this subtitle as &#8216;Relationship&#8217; or something like that, but it&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s kinda a problem of mine and I have to deal with it very carefully and hopefully it turn out to be good.</p>

<p>  I really really miss her during the days i was in Beijing, just right after i finished the project in company, i keep thinking about her. i can help myself.</p>

<p>  luckily i got some chances to see her sometimes, those moments are wonderful and I want more.</p>

<p>  We use to hang out frequently and maybe that why i am always motivated back in the days i am in school, it&#8217;s a huge lose if i can not have that anymore:(</p>

<p>  We had pizza at <strong>pizzahut</strong> last night, and walked in the snow, talking and laughing about her exs and some of my awkward stories. for quite a long i always thought we&#8217;ve never went out on rain or something like that, but this time we got snow, white, pretty snow. so, overall it&#8217;s feels nice! I never walk with a girl in the snow, so, luckily me, for i picked the right day. but, i was planed to buy her something, just like the story we talked earlier, it&#8217;s about a couple in a shop, the boy buy girl a cloth while she is trying it in changing room, and after she came out, the boy ask the girl to run, like escape and steal that cloth. yeah, i actually planned to do that, but.. we didn&#8217;t find a nice shop yesterday night:(</p>

<ul>
<li>NOTES

<ol>
<li><p>Our first official date was go to the movie, after we brought the tickets, i suggested we eat at pizzahut nearby the theater, but then she wanted to eat at a cheaper restaurant &#8220;yoshinoya&#8221;. at that time i thought maybe she don&#8217;t want me to spend too much money on our first date, but it just turned out that she is just <strong>simply</strong> don&#8217;t like pizzahut:(</p></li>
<li><p>That movie is total crap, we were all confused about that movies.</p></li>
<li><p>I still keep those tickets. the <strong>only</strong> movie we watch together.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought she loves going to the movies, in fact, she doesn&#8217;t and i, ask her to movies for like thousand times.. silly me!!</p></li>
<li><p>I asked her to movie again, TODAY.. dumb, no wonder her dump you in the first place. :(:(</p></li>
<li><p>NOTES above shows I need to get to know her more!</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>  but, the sad part is, i don&#8217;t know when we can meet again and this is really bothering me. i didn&#8217;t cherish the time we had before and took it for grant for so long. anyway, new year is about to come and i will post later.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>God! I Love School, It Feels so good!</h3>

		<p>hi you, sorry i recently had so much stuffs want to write, but i again again to tell myself, you have gotta learn the iptables first, then move this blog with the domain to a new place, then write. but, i just found out it doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with the iptables, it&#8217;s apache that do the job. so, i give myself sometime to set up the apache, meanwhile, write those post while i still can remember things:)</p>

<p>first of all, i had great fun at Dec 11, knows as 11.11. i hung out with a very close friend, and we had great meal and watched the moveie The Bourne Legacy, even thought i watched this movie before, but, it&#8217;s okay to watch it again, when you have someone to keep you company:) i knew she had some difficult time with study and the other stuffs, but, anyway. Since we both knew the 11.11 means nothing to us, it just make this day much easier. i had the girl i care about and she had a boyfriend she love very much:) so, i think i am not the ones who got a reason to celebrity that day, because i am FALLING IN LOVE with someone, and i think now everyone knows that. but anway, who needs another friends when you had a friend like she, it just make my life easier, at least when i felt down, she&#8217;s always the one i can talk to. and she understand me more than any of my friends do.</p>

<p>then, back to a another topic. i can not focus on coding recently, lucky enough, i got Taylor Swift&#8217;s songs and coffee, but, i just miss her more and more, she is such  a awesome girl and i never met a girl like her before. and all of a suddenly, when i walk on the road to eat, i came up with this one:</p>

<p>&#8220;she is the source of my source, sorry about the bugs, blame her!&#8221;</p>

<p>i even post a question on Quora, to see and share with other programmers who feel the same way:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Programmers/Are-there-any-romantic-programming-programmer-quotes">http://www.quora.com/Programmers/Are-there-any-romantic-programming-programmer-quotes</a></p>

<p>i really really wish i can spend more that with her, when i had chance, to tell her how i felt about her, face to face.</p>

<p>and another topic, about her, again,(why always her!!) now, i just can not figure out what is REALLY going on, so, wish me luck.</p>

<p>i watch a short video &#8220;The Last&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc3NTg4MjAw.html">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc3NTg4MjAw.html</a></p>

<p>it&#8217;s about a guy&#8217;s view on his previous girlfriends and i somehow, want to write one too, even though, i am still alone now.</p>

<p>my version is about some programming language i know and how i felt about them, but trust me, in fact, it&#8217;s</p>

<p>not about programming language, it&#8217;s about her and some other girls:)</p>

<p>the last is about some options i got and i can not decided which one to choose yet. it really kills me, so, i will let</p>

<p>you know when i make the final decision:)</p>

<p>good night:)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Hi, I just got back from Tianjin and had some great meat with my friends from my dev team. I&#8217;d been in school like in five days or so, it&#8217;s strange I didn&#8217;t call it crapland :( and here is why I don&#8217;t call it crapland:
First of all, finally, after about half years long waiting, I got a chance to meet Vivian again, yeah, because I really can not come up with any new words to describe her, but, I am lucky enough to see her again. so  thrilled I got the last night before  head off, I just could not sleep and get up very early then just begin to run, Ok, that&#8217;s a little fake:( I didn&#8217;t run. Then, the funny thing is when I just get out of my apartment, I got a feeling like, someone&#8217;s  Dear PERIOD is about to come, and It turned out I was right, The one, the girl I&#8217;ve been miss for so long, got her PERIOD to visit, just one or more hours  ahead of me to see her. so, I wait one more extra day to spend with my friends. that&#8217;s the my 1st day in Tianjin.(Saturday).</p>

<p>Sunday, it&#8217;s absolutely the highlight of this short visit. When I just woke up, seeing my phone got a new  text, somehow I just feel, (AGAIN, how amazing is that?!) it&#8217;s none other than the girl I dream about, finally, gave me a chance to meet her again, just like the old days. Then I had the best three hours of this visit.she showed me some of her designs, even though I am not a fashion guy at all:) but I can tell, she love her works, just like I love my code:) and we went to the drinking shop we used to visit a lot, then, went back to school because she&#8217;s got class to take. also, just like the old days.</p>

<p>P.S.: The only program I wrote those days is the one I call &#8220;wesaid&#8221; in my phone, i wrote this on the first day of this short trip, the night before i meet  you., I use &#8220;wesaid&#8221; to remind me what we said in the last years, on the exact same day. this program intent to be UN-expandable, meaning this is for one phone number and one phone number only, and i won&#8217;t use this on other girls, i promise:) it&#8217;s too dangerous.</p>

<p>and the next a few days was kinda interesting, too. in fact, I know &#8220;MISS Hot Heart Classmate&#8221; for  about a year, we met, passed by for so many times, which leads me became more and more interested about her, and want to get to know her better, Luckily, I ask her out at a &#8220;Perfect Right time&#8221;, her  class was kinda late, she&#8217;s kinda hungry and she loves the hot pot. So, we had a night of hot pot, and we talk a lot, definitely more friendly, interesting more those new-just-get-to-know-couples.  it&#8217;s like a date but I think we both agree that&#8217;s not a date, still, it&#8217;s fun to finally get to know her,  and her didn&#8217;t disappoint me at all, she&#8217;s interested with beautiful smile, and got talent for telling/creating jokes :>
but, I doubt she is good at C programming<sup>^</sup>
and next a few days got little bored but it&#8217;s ok:)
and finally, i get back to Beijing and post this blog. good night. and hope i can see you guys again, soon:)</p>

		<p>hi, i am back to write some post again:)</p>

<p>it&#8217;s the 3rd or 4th blog since a started this kinda life at Beijing, and it&#8217;s just, humm, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s very special times i had. i had some troubles in school, which i really don&#8217;t give it a shit about, and besides, my intern-ship is quite smoothy, or at least i think it that way. our product is about to release at the part that i covered, it looks good to me, even thought that part wasn&#8217;t as mush attractive as kernel and filesystem to me, which i am about to get really deep into those stuffs, but anyway, it&#8217;s gonna end. and i now can really put myself into the field that i love best.</p>

<p>i made some really great friends here, a very lovely girl live across my room, and she can cook for me sometimes, even thought it&#8217;s not that yummy:( and , oh, she&#8217;s a nice and beautiful girl, but, i know we will never hit it off, so, just keep that way and it&#8217;s good. at least i have a good roommate &amp; friends:)</p>

<p>and i also made friends with the guys in our development team, they are really really nice to me, even thought some of them are elder than me, but, yeah, them approved/acknowledge my skills and will let me to help them to solve some problems they had. which i feel kinda proud of myself. good job out there, sunus!</p>

<p>and we hang out a lot, drinking and play polos. it&#8217;s just a lot of fun with them and i think we&#8217;ll become brothers one day;)</p>

<p>and the final, big news, i might get a chance to meet the girl of my dream, again, after she dump me months ago. who knows :(</p>

<p>wish me luck !</p>

<p>bye and wish u a happy mid-autunm festival!</p>
