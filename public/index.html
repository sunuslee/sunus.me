		<p>hi you, sorry i recently had so much stuffs want to write, but i again again to tell myself, you have gotta learn the iptables first, then move this blog with the domain to a new place, then write. but, i just found out it doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with the iptables, it&#8217;s apache that do the job. so, i give myself sometime to set up the apache, meanwhile, write those post while i still can remember things:)</p>

<p>first of all, i had great fun at Dec 11, knows as 11.11. i hung out with a very close friend, and we had great meal and watched the moveie The Bourne Legacy, even thought i watched this movie before, but, it&#8217;s okay to watch it again, when you have someone to keep you company:) i knew she had some difficult time with study and the other stuffs, but, anyway. Since we both knew the 11.11 means nothing to us, it just make this day much easier. i had the girl i care about and she had a boyfriend she love very much:) so, i think i am not the ones who got a reason to celebrity that day, because i am FALLING IN LOVE with someone, and i think now everyone knows that. but anway, who needs another friends when you had a friend like she, it just make my life easier, at least when i felt down, she&#8217;s always the one i can talk to. and she understand me more than any of my friends do.</p>

<p>then, back to a another topic. i can not focus on coding recently, lucky enough, i got Taylor Swift&#8217;s songs and coffee, but, i just miss her more and more, she is such  a awesome girl and i never met a girl like her before. and all of a suddenly, when i walk on the road to eat, i came up with this one:</p>

<p>&#8220;she is the source of my source, sorry about the bugs, blame her!&#8221;</p>

<p>i even post a question on Quora, to see and share with other programmers who feel the same way:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Programmers/Are-there-any-romantic-programming-programmer-quotes">http://www.quora.com/Programmers/Are-there-any-romantic-programming-programmer-quotes</a></p>

<p>i really really wish i can spend more that with her, when i had chance, to tell her how i felt about her, face to face.</p>

<p>and another topic, about her, again,(why always her!!) now, i just can not figure out what is REALLY going on, so, wish me luck.</p>

<p>i watch a short video &#8220;The Last&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc3NTg4MjAw.html">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc3NTg4MjAw.html</a></p>

<p>it&#8217;s about a guy&#8217;s view on his previous girlfriends and i somehow, want to write one too, even though, i am still alone now.</p>

<p>my version is about some programming language i know and how i felt about them, but trust me, in fact, it&#8217;s</p>

<p>not about programming language, it&#8217;s about her and some other girls:)</p>

<p>the last is about some options i got and i can not decided which one to choose yet. it really kills me, so, i will let</p>

<p>you know when i make the final decision:)</p>

<p>good night:)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Hi, I just got back from Tianjin and had some great meat with my friends from my dev team. I&#8217;d been in school like in five days or so, it&#8217;s strange I didn&#8217;t call it crapland :( and here is why I don&#8217;t call it crapland:
First of all, finally, after about half years long waiting, I got a chance to meet Vivian again, yeah, because I really can not come up with any new words to describe her, but, I am lucky enough to see her again. so  thrilled I got the last night before  head off, I just could not sleep and get up very early then just begin to run, Ok, that&#8217;s a little fake:( I didn&#8217;t run. Then, the funny thing is when I just get out of my apartment, I got a feeling like, someone&#8217;s  Dear PERIOD is about to come, and It turned out I was right, The one, the girl I&#8217;ve been miss for so long, got her PERIOD to visit, just one or more hours  ahead of me to see her. so, I wait one more extra day to spend with my friends. that&#8217;s the my 1st day in Tianjin.(Saturday).</p>

<p>Sunday, it&#8217;s absolutely the highlight of this short visit. When I just woke up, seeing my phone got a new  text, somehow I just feel, (AGAIN, how amazing is that?!) it&#8217;s none other than the girl I dream about, finally, gave me a chance to meet her again, just like the old days. Then I had the best three hours of this visit.she showed me some of her designs, even though I am not a fashion guy at all:) but I can tell, she love her works, just like I love my code:) and we went to the drinking shop we used to visit a lot, then, went back to school because she&#8217;s got class to take. also, just like the old days.</p>

<p>P.S.: The only program I wrote those days is the one I call &#8220;wesaid&#8221; in my phone, i wrote this on the first day of this short trip, the night before i meet  you., I use &#8220;wesaid&#8221; to remind me what we said in the last years, on the exact same day. this program intent to be UN-expandable, meaning this is for one phone number and one phone number only, and i won&#8217;t use this on other girls, i promise:) it&#8217;s too dangerous.</p>

<p>and the next a few days was kinda interesting, too. in fact, I know &#8220;MISS Hot Heart Classmate&#8221; for  about a year, we met, passed by for so many times, which leads me became more and more interested about her, and want to get to know her better, Luckily, I ask her out at a &#8220;Perfect Right time&#8221;, her  class was kinda late, she&#8217;s kinda hungry and she loves the hot pot. So, we had a night of hot pot, and we talk a lot, definitely more friendly, interesting more those new-just-get-to-know-couples.  it&#8217;s like a date but I think we both agree that&#8217;s not a date, still, it&#8217;s fun to finally get to know her,  and her didn&#8217;t disappoint me at all, she&#8217;s interested with beautiful smile, and got talent for telling/creating jokes :>
but, I doubt she is good at C programming<sup>^</sup>
and next a few days got little bored but it&#8217;s ok:)
and finally, i get back to Beijing and post this blog. good night. and hope i can see you guys again, soon:)</p>

		<p>hi, i am back to write some post again:)</p>

<p>it&#8217;s the 3rd or 4th blog since a started this kinda life at Beijing, and it&#8217;s just, humm, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s very special times i had. i had some troubles in school, which i really don&#8217;t give it a shit about, and besides, my intern-ship is quite smoothy, or at least i think it that way. our product is about to release at the part that i covered, it looks good to me, even thought that part wasn&#8217;t as mush attractive as kernel and filesystem to me, which i am about to get really deep into those stuffs, but anyway, it&#8217;s gonna end. and i now can really put myself into the field that i love best.</p>

<p>i made some really great friends here, a very lovely girl live across my room, and she can cook for me sometimes, even thought it&#8217;s not that yummy:( and , oh, she&#8217;s a nice and beautiful girl, but, i know we will never hit it off, so, just keep that way and it&#8217;s good. at least i have a good roommate &amp; friends:)</p>

<p>and i also made friends with the guys in our development team, they are really really nice to me, even thought some of them are elder than me, but, yeah, them approved/acknowledge my skills and will let me to help them to solve some problems they had. which i feel kinda proud of myself. good job out there, sunus!</p>

<p>and we hang out a lot, drinking and play polos. it&#8217;s just a lot of fun with them and i think we&#8217;ll become brothers one day;)</p>

<p>and the final, big news, i might get a chance to meet the girl of my dream, again, after she dump me months ago. who knows :(</p>

<p>wish me luck !</p>

<p>bye and wish u a happy mid-autunm festival!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>yeah, after about two months of intern-ship in Beijing, i get back to my sweet home for a couple of days.stay with my family and friends. it&#8217;s  really really happy time spent with them, and my sisters they are doing really really good so i am proud of them :) ps, i bought my mom a new SAMSUNG GALAXY smart phone using my first salary, it did feels great!</p>

<p>and my friends, yeah, i really really want them to  change their names, but i didn&#8217;t get the perfect girl i want , didn&#8217;t bring her to my city then let my friends see how awesome and amazing she is, and how lucky i am if i had a girlfriend like she:) anyway, i still like her a lot even thought i am trying really really hard to meet some new girls and hangout with them, do things we did when we first met, but, they are, they are just NOTHING ON U. and i know now, i can not forget you for sure:( i keep the movie tickets we saw together,  the birthday gifts i wished i could give you by my side,which i know you will like it, but, you never know what that is:( and i also want to finish those drinks on the street, it&#8217;s like one or two more cups, and we can get some free drinks. sorry, i can not remember the exact numbers.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t even know whether you will read this far or not, i don&#8217;t even know whether you will ever come to this blog or not. but if you do, even if i don&#8217;t know whether you had been there for a while or not, it&#8217;s okay.  if i were you, i saw this blog and i know much this guy likes you. i will be crying:) kidding</p>

<p>and my intern-ship goes very smoothly, the company is growing and i am doing kinda good job there. so not much to talk about.</p>

<p>anyway, new chapter of my life goes on, and you are the only missing part of my new chapter.! hoping you can be in it, some day, maybe, perhaps :)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Hi, It’s been a while since the last post, isn’t it ? so many things going on those days, I got dumped , yeah, I got dumped by a very amazing and awesome girl that I’ve always talked about.</p>

<p>and some of my friends I played a lot counter-striker with are graduated from university, so no more counter-strike for a while.(OH REALL? I don’t know:D)</p>

<p>they are a bunch of nice guys and brothers to me and I am looking forward to play with them again!</p>

<p>it’s sad, but life moves on, as it always does.</p>

<p>and I came to Beijing on July 1st, (WOW! FINALLY!) I can feel that there is a very exciting , interesting and wonderful journey just right there waiting for me to explore, to experience. and I am ready to embrace all of those wonderful things! such as new opportunities, new apartments and new roommates:) i think some of them is kinda interesting, i am looking forward to meet them:)</p>

<p>let’s talk about what I did recently, finally, I choose the best offer I can get and starting to write some serious codes :) it’s fun and it just really surprise me a lot!</p>

<p>I kind of thoughts that I am kinda good at what I do, that’s coding, but when I FINALLY got here and starting working, I just found out there’s so many people are just really really good at it, too. most of them are older than me, but they just know so so so many skills than I do, I don’t know what I will become a year or two year later, hoping I can be much better than they’re now, lol !</p>

<p>the environment of my workspace is very nice, I am very very satisfied can my very first intern job can be like this. I can get a very nice sleep, and get up anytime I want, then head off to my office. because there’s no such rule that requires you have to be the office before a specific time, this is what I really love about this company! the food here is ok, but I can deal with that. by the way, the front-desk girl is kinda cute and I ACCIDENTALLY  pissed her off several times LOL!, even thought I just got here some day ago, sorry about that:(, but I really really didn’t do those things on purpose, I just don’t know much about the rules..</p>

<p>so, right now I just need to work hard and prove my worth and make more friends and pay some EXTRA attention to the relationships that may just come in, who knows LOL!</p>

<p>anyhow, I still think of you a lot, and I saw a girl like you a lot right in the subway, even thought I knew that girl isn’t you for sure, but my heart just beat faster at that moment. i now can move on with my life, hope u can do the same:)</p>

<p>see you!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>it had been a while since i turned 0x16. and the last week was just AMAZING for me, and i don&#8217;t even believe everything went so smooth(or i think?) and finally, wow!</p>

<p>first of all, it all started with a mail, then i got the second mail, third&#8230;. i was kinda had doubt in myself in the first place. but now. i do know that i am useful and people want me to work with them.</p>

<p>so, i went to Beijing on Friday, took some interviews and it all went smooth. so i got several options . now i am weighting all the pros and cons. some of the options do not interests me as the others. but anyway, this time i have to made up my mind on my own and whatever it ends, i won&#8217;t regret about it.</p>

<p>Now, i was about to get the intern . Making money by doing things i&#8217;ve been loving for so long. It&#8217;s time to figure out what i need to do with that girl  i always talked about, we haven&#8217;t been talk since like a months ago. i Did made a promise to myself, don&#8217;t contact her till i get the intern, i thought it might be kinda long, but somehow, i just kinda luck. so i put this second import thing of this semester on the table. hoping she still likes me:) because i will tell her how i felt about her and what i want from her.  i don&#8217;t know how this ends, but i am kinda looking forward to that moment. even if i got the bad answer, at least i will try. i have the courage to speak it out, loudly:)</p>

<p>good night, wish u have the good luck as i did in last three days.</p>

		<p>humm, i feel like i am not young anymore. but, i am still doing those &#8216;young people&#8217; stuffs that i really really feel some kinda ashamed of. so, it&#8217;s time to grow up. in fact, i know i am growing up with time goes by.
in this very moment, right before i turn to 0x16, i would like to post something, something that i wanted to say several days ago.
first of all, i am so grateful for my family for they gave me a very very nice childhood. even though sometimes i felt it just not enough, but deep down in my heart, i knew they did what they could and i will always grateful for what they&#8217;ve gave to me. i just love to have them around me!
second, i&#8217;d like to thank all of my friends, for the time we spent together, for the happiness and sadness we shared. i&#8217;m really really proud of having you guys. I will do everything i can to make you feel the same way as i do, that is, i am hoping one day, you will feel proud of having me as your friend.
one last thing, i also want to end this with something suddenly came up of my head several days ago,  to my family,  friends and the ones i love:</p>

<p>i am trying hard to to a guy that deserves you.</p>

<p>because you are just so AMAZING.</p>

<p>hope i will not let you guys down before i turn to 0x17.</p>

<p>good night:)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hi, i&#8217;ve got a busy week, and i still got a lot of codes to write and i am happy that i still got something to do.
the project tmenny is about to launch and my resume-generator is almost finished. in the very beginning,  i was about to write it in ruby,which i just learned those days. but quickly i found out i might do this in the language i love most, that is, C. so,i wrote so much more lines of codes than ruby/python but i love the way C codes works. simple, clear and fast. and i can figure out almost what is going on under the every line of codes.that is just feels good!</p>

<p>humm, i really miss the days when we ACTUALLY hang out together last semester. sometime i don&#8217;t feel the same way
as we&#8217;re in school while i teach you some programming stuffs or just walk with you,strange.
even though i met someone new and we had great time, still i would rather going out taking 951 with you.</p>

<p>SK failed again and some of my really good friends are going to leave this school, including the one i just met, which is pretty sad for my to accept.</p>

<p>i am not quite quitting counter-strike yet, as we haven&#8217;t been &#8216;actually&#8217; &#8216;hang out&#8217; lately, it&#8217;s fun playing counter-strike on lan. but if i got chance hanging out with you, i will definitely pick you for sure. it&#8217;s just 10 times fun than just playing game with nine guys :&lt;</p>

<p>hoping i can getting in 951 soon.
good night, gotta code tomorrow.</p>
