	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>yeah, this semester is finally over and i am setting in the subway&#8217;s waiting for my train back home. and right now the this place is playing one of my favorite song <em>you belong with me</em> by <em>Taylor Swift</em></p>

<p>Overall, this semester is kind nice. I tried a few new stuffs and i found that i liked them:)</p>

<p>In the beginning of this semester, i thought i might have some more time spend with that awesome girl, that girl who dumped but i still care about, etc. but it just didn&#8217;t happen, we just met a few time. but it still felt great, actually. can anyone give me one good reason to stop thinking of her:(</p>

<p>Also, i put some time on that team in school, it didn&#8217;t end up like i excepted before, but i didn&#8217;t want to talk about it that much, it just ok and i am really looking forward to continue this in next semester.</p>

<p>In the end of this semester, i met a few great people in Beijing. the first one is Xavier, we&#8217;ve been known for like a year, and look at him, he already start him second startup company and they looks promising. we talk about technic stuffs and what filed might have chance for us, etc. the incredible part is that he still remember how we met at first time, we both take the wrong subway and get off at wrong station. that&#8217;s fun. we will be partner, in the future, i think:)</p>

<p>And yesterday, that was a really nice day:) I might remember that day for a while. It just simply fun and nice. she was the receptionist girl at that time when i first met her, in the company where i got my first job interview. yeah, it about a year ago, i felt her was <strong>cute</strong> at that time, but actually, we didn&#8217;t talk much.</p>

<p>Yesterday, i finally got a chance to met her and not doing any kinds of interviews, instead we played billiards and had dinner together:) I lost the billiards game to her, but i didn&#8217;t feel ashamed at all, LOL. then we went to a barbecue restaurant that i like a lot. it was a nice place with fun shows to watch. and I gave out my first <strong>on stage</strong> dance in that place:( which, right not i still can not believe that i actually did those things.</p>

<p>She is still cute, besides i felt like we have a lot in common so that we didn&#8217;t end up like running out of topics to talk about, which i was kinda afraid before we met. also, her personality is good, just like i excepted.</p>

<p>She said she had a good time that night, more that once. which I am not sure if she really mean it or not:) but anyway, it&#8217;s always good to here stuffs like this.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how she think of me, but i think we will met again, then, i will win the billiard game, at least:)</p>

<p>Also there&#8217;re some funny parts i think i should also mention in here.</p>

<ol>
<li>I lost the billiards game, i did make some brilliant shots. but somehow, i just lose.</li>
<li>When we got to the restaurant, we had to siting right next to each other, on the one side of the table. but i like setting in front of people, i thought that&#8217;s more comfortable. we both sitting in the one side of that table just looks like much more intimate. The reason we do this is because that table has a really  good view of the show, which made it less awkward.</li>
<li>luckily, i think she liked the show.</li>
<li>when we about to got back, in the bus station.

<ul>
<li>she said <strong>are you sure you can find your way back to the hotel? should i take you to there?</strong></li>
<li>i replied <strong>i think i can, besides, my hotel&#8217;s traffic is not that good&#8230; </strong></li>
<li>then, she yelled at me <strong>who says i want to take you to the hotel? i just want to take you to a subway station, blahblah&#8230;</strong></li>
<li>OK, that was awkward enough. haha ;(</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s probably how i end this semester, the summer vacation is starting from right now, let&#8217;s enjoy it yay :)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3>It&#8217;s been a while</h3>

<p>yeah, it&#8217;s been a while since i got back from holiday. and i got so much work to do lately, personal and school stuffs.</p>

<p>first of all, i confirmed with my teacher that the team we have now, needs new guys and needs them badly. the members we have now are great, but they have their own stuffs to care take of and i have no right to ask them to do anything, so i totally understand them.</p>

<p>second, about the goal out group needs to accomplished, it&#8217;s kinda big and hard. so, i hope the new guys grow more quick:) who knows. they are young, motivated, that&#8217;s good. i think.</p>

<p>I think i am about to give a <strong>public presentation</strong> in a few days later, in school. so, there&#8217;s a great chance to let people to know me better. also, there might be another chance of meeting the right person. so, i need to get it prepared well. and i think i do. and that&#8217;s kinda funny.</p>

<p>I do a few so-called-interview today. that&#8217;s another funny story:)</p>

<p>I met a really great girl last week, yeah, she is really great but i don&#8217;t think we will end up well. she is too great for me. i got her number which i won&#8217;t call in the near future.</p>

<p>that last thing is, i met vivian tonight again. which i don&#8217;t have a clue what we will talk about. so i just give her a stuffs i brought from holiday. again, i didn&#8217;t think i will give it to her, because i decided not to talk to her long time ago.  but, it just happened.</p>

<p>I just can not move on. that&#8217;s sad:( but i will just keep trying.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>I didn&#8217;t write this, i found the post a few days ago and i think it can be very helpful, so i make a copy here.</h2>

<h3><a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">Original Link Here</a></h3>

<h1>First 5 Minutes Troubleshooting A Server</h1>

<p>Back when our team was dealing with operations, optimization and scalability at <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">our previous company</a>, we had our fair share of troubleshooting poorly performing applications and infrastructures of various sizes, often large (think CNN or the World Bank). Tight deadlines, “exotic” technical stacks and lack of information usually made for memorable experiences.</p>

<p>The cause of the issues was rarely obvious: here are a few things we usually got started with.</p>

<h3>Get some context</h3>

<p>Don’t rush on the servers just yet, you need to figure out how much is already known about the server and the specifics of the issues. You don’t want to waste your time (trouble) shooting in the dark.</p>

<p>A few “must have”:</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly are the symptoms of the issue? Unresponsiveness? Errors?</li>
<li>When did the problem start being noticed?</li>
<li>Is it reproducible?</li>
<li>Any pattern (e.g. happens every hour)?</li>
<li>What were the latest changes on the platform (code, servers, stack)?</li>
<li>Does it affect a specific user segment (logged in, logged out, geographically located…)?</li>
<li>Is there any documentation for the architecture (physical and logical)?</li>
<li><strong>Is there a monitoring platform?</strong> Munin, Zabbix, Nagios, <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>… Anything will do.</li>
<li><strong>Any (centralized) logs?</strong>. Loggly, Airbrake, Graylog…</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two ones are the most convenient sources of information, but don’t expect too much: they’re also the ones usually painfully absent. Tough luck, make a note to get this corrected and move on.</p>

<h3>Who’s there?</h3>

<pre><code>$ w
$ last
</code></pre>

<p>Not critical, but you’d rather not be troubleshooting a platform others are playing with. One cook in the kitchen is enough.</p>

<h3>What was previously done?</h3>

<pre><code>$ history
</code></pre>

<p>Always a good thing to look at; combined with the knowledge of who was on the box earlier on. Be responsible by all means, being admin shouldn’t allow you to break ones privacy.</p>

<p>A quick mental note for later, you may want to update the environment variable <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> to keep track of the time those commands were ran. Nothing is more frustrating than investigating an outdated list of commands…</p>

<h3>What is running?</h3>

<pre><code>$ pstree -a
$ ps aux
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>ps aux</code> tends to be pretty verbose, <code>pstree -a</code> gives you a nice condensed view of what is running and who called what.</p>

<h3>Listening services</h3>

<pre><code>$ netstat -ntlp
$ netstat -nulp
$ netstat -nxlp
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to prefer running them separately, mainly because I don’t like looking at all the services at the same time. <code>netstat -nalp</code> will do to though. Even then, I’d ommit the <code>numeric</code> option (IPs are more readable IMHO).</p>

<p>Identify the running services and whether they’re expected to be running or not. Look for the various listening ports. You can always match the PID of the process with the output of <code>ps aux</code>; this can be quite useful especially when you end up with 2 or 3 Java or Erlang processes running concurrently.</p>

<p>We usual prefer to have more or less specialized boxes, with a low number of services running on each one of them. If you see 3 dozens of listening ports you probably should make a mental note of investigating this further and see what can be cleaned up or reorganized.</p>

<h3>CPU and RAM</h3>

<pre><code>$ free -m
$ uptime
$ top
$ htop
</code></pre>

<p>This should answer a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any free RAM? Is it swapping?</li>
<li>Is there still some CPU left? How many CPU cores are available on the server? Is one of them overloaded?</li>
<li>What is causing the most load on the box? What is the load average?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hardware</h3>

<pre><code>$ lspci
$ dmidecode
$ ethtool
</code></pre>

<p>There are still a lot of bare-metal servers out there, this should help with;</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying the RAID card (with BBU?), the CPU, the available memory slots. This may give you some hints on potential issues and/or performance improvements.</li>
<li>Is your NIC properly set? Are you running in half-duplex? In 10MBps? Any TX/RX errors?</li>
</ul>


<h3>IO Performances</h3>

<pre><code>$ iostat -kx 2
$ vmstat 2 10
$ mpstat 2 10
$ dstat --top-io --top-bio
</code></pre>

<p>Very useful commands to analyze the overall performances of your backend;</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking the disk usage: has the box a filesystem/disk with 100% disk usage?</li>
<li>Is the swap currently in use (si/so)?</li>
<li>What is using the CPU: system? User? Stolen (VM)?</li>
<li><code>dstat</code> is my all-time favorite. What is using the IO? Is MySQL sucking up the resources? Is it your PHP processes?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mount points and filesystems</h3>

<pre><code>$ mount
$ cat /etc/fstab
$ vgs
$ pvs
$ lvs
$ df -h
$ lsof %2BD / /* beware not to kill your box */
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>How many filesystems are mounted?</li>
<li>Is there a dedicated filesystem for some of the services? (MySQL by any chance..?)</li>
<li>What are the filesystem mount options: noatime? default? Have some filesystem been re-mounted as read-only?</li>
<li>Do you have any disk space left?</li>
<li>Is there any big (deleted) files that haven’t been flushed yet?</li>
<li>Do you have room to extend a partition if disk space is an issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Kernel, interrupts and network usage</h3>

<pre><code>$ sysctl -a | grep ...
$ cat /proc/interrupts
$ cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack /* may take some time on busy servers */
$ netstat
$ ss -s
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Are your IRQ properly balanced across the CPU? Or is one of the core overloaded because of network interrupts, raid card, …?</li>
<li>How much is swappinness set to? 60 is good enough for workstations, but when it come to servers this is generally a bad idea: you do not want your server to swap… ever. Otherwise your swapping process will be locked while data is read/written to the disk.</li>
<li>Is <code>conntrack_max</code> set to a high enough number to handle your traffic?</li>
<li>How long do you maintain TCP connections in the various states (<code>TIME_WAIT</code>, …)?</li>
<li><code>netstat</code> can be a bit slow to display all the existing connections, you may want to use <code>ss</code> instead to get a summary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.lognormal.com/blog/2012/09/27/linux-tcpip-tuning/">Linux TCP tuning</a> for some more pointer as to how to tune your network stack.</p>

<h3>System logs and kernel messages</h3>

<pre><code>$ dmesg
$ less /var/log/messages
$ less /var/log/secure
$ less /var/log/auth
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Look for any error or warning messages; is it spitting issues about the number of connections in your conntrack being too high?</li>
<li>Do you see any hardware error, or filesystem error?</li>
<li>Can you correlate the time from those events with the information provided beforehand?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cronjobs</h3>

<pre><code>$ ls /etc/cron* %2B cat
$ for user in $(cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:); do crontab -l -u $user; done
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Is there any cron job that is running too often?</li>
<li>Is there some user’s cron that is “hidden” to the common eyes?</li>
<li>Was there a backup of some sort running at the time of the issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Application logs</h3>

<p>There is a lot to analyze here, but it’s unlikely you’ll have time to be exhaustive at first. Focus on the obvious ones, for example in the case of a LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apache &amp; Nginx</strong>; chase down access and error logs, look for <code>5xx</code> errors, look for possible <code>limit_zone</code> errors.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong>; look for errors in the <code>mysql.log</code>, trace of corrupted tables, innodb repair process in progress. Looks for slow logs and define if there is disk/index/query issues.</li>
<li><strong>PHP-FPM</strong>; if you have php-slow logs on, dig in and try to find errors (php, mysql, memcache, …). If not, set it on.</li>
<li><strong>Varnish</strong>; in <code>varnishlog</code> and <code>varnishstat</code>, check your hit/miss ratio. Are you missing some rules in your config that let end-users hit your backend instead?</li>
<li><strong>HA-Proxy</strong>; what is your backend status? Are your health-checks successful? Do you hit your max queue size on the frontend or your backends?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After these first 5 minutes (give or take 10 minutes) you should have a better understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is running.</li>
<li>Whether the issue seems to be related to IO/hardware/networking or configuration (bad code, kernel tuning, …).</li>
<li>Whether there’s a pattern you recognize: for example a bad use of the DB indexes, or too many apache workers.</li>
</ul>


<p>You may even have found the actual root cause. If not, you should be in a good place to start digging further, with the knowledge that you’ve covered the obvious.</p>

<p>We got a problem with the networking in my dorm and laboratory, if outgoing traffic port is 3389, the connection will be banned. so, we need to figure a way out to connect a Windows server&#8217;s 3389 port, which is suck, i mean, Windows sucks.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>I connected to one of the linux server which is in the same lan with Suck Windows Server with port, let&#8217;s say 63389. the the linux with redirect the connection from 63389 to Suck Windows Server&#8217;s port 3389.</p>

<p>this is what i did in the linux server:</p>

<pre><code>    iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING 1 -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 63389 -j DNAT --to-destination SUCK-WIN-IP:3389
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 3389 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>the second target <strong> MASQUERADE </strong> is a really handy thing, it will be acting like SNAT most times, but it can also auto-adjust some connection problems with extra <strong>COST</strong></p>

		<h1>Summary for the past</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>the &#8220;thing&#8221; i do in school, still making very slow progress, some of the guys starting contribute to the group, i am glad to see that.</p></li>
<li><p>i made a small web app called find-the-one for guokr group&#8217;s searching. it works fine, i learn some new technic and it might be helpful in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li>the very first redone of i made that is because I was trying to find if there&#8217;s any girl i might found interesting in tianjin. so i wrote that app, it seems that my hope <strong>didn&#8217;t come true.</strong></li>
<li>but, there is quite amount of people like that app and using it. so, i am glad i can make another stuff people like.</li>
<li>that app is in the Guokr.com&#8217;s homepage :) it got about 1000pv in it&#8217;s first day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h1>Some other stuff</h1>

<p>  basically, i write this just want to say， i am trying so hard to moving on, and i think somehow, it might work :)</p>

<p>  And there&#8217;s another interesting story, there&#8217;s a front desk girl i ‘kinda’ like from the company that gave me the very first job offer but i didn&#8217;t accept in the end. she saw my WeiBo about IronMan3, and we talk about the comment &#8216;haha hahaha hahahaha&#8217; i gave to that movie, i went great and i found her interesting too, and she like&#8217;s billiard too. so, I might have chance to see her again, but not interview involved this time! good luck.</p>

<p>  One last thing, i am gonna to re-watch the An <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1866479/" title="The Avengers">The Avengers</a> again, since i just finished the IronMan 3 a few days ago.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/04/21/i-dont-like-this-busy-week/">I Don&#8217;t Like This Busy Week, but I Made It Through. So Far</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hi, it&#8217;s been a while:) i just had some busy weeks and finally, i think i can take a break now. i can spend more time with friends and my personal work, plus some go on dates, if i am <strong>luckily</strong> enough.</p>

<p>i had been playing multiply roles for some weeks.</p>

<h3>System Administrator</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since the data on our servers got destroyed by mistake, i have to do that form scratch and got some new problems, mostly because we now work at a new lab with different networking enviroment.  it took some extra work. and also i have to re-write and setup our team wiki pages. i think that wiki is important but some of the guys in the team didn&#8217;t think that way, fine. now i can say that with confident that i am fully qualified for a <strong>SA</strong> position:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>HR guy</h3>

<ul>
<li>All right, it&#8217;s not that <strong>official</strong>, but i do have some rights at this team right now, and i did have received some resumes and <strong>hire</strong> someone to do stuffs with us, LOL. hoping i hired the right guy. and i am still want people to work with us, see the recruiting ad here:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf" title="download os-recuriting.pdf">PDF version: http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo">HTML version: http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>i am waiting, join us soon:)</li>
</ul>


<h3><em>Talker</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what the fuck the <em>talker</em> is ? but i can explain what that is, i talked with some of the main members our this team, asked their thougths on this <strong>thing</strong> we are doing right now, what&#8217;re they thinking and what they want to do next. and their answer is just, let&#8217;s say, simple.</li>
<li>I used to have pretty high admire on them, and i used to think i can count on them. but right now, i think i have to re-consider those thoughts. obviously they have other pressing matters right now, i have no comment on this and i have no right to judge them. but, i have mine too, and it&#8217;s the main reason why i came back this year. it&#8217;s definitely <strong>NOT</strong> what we do right now. if you don&#8217;t have motivation or this s not interested to you any more, you can quit. because at this point, i just find out every one right now are replaceable, i can not see the quality/ability we need in you right now, but, i once think you have those.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Secretary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes, secretary. I wrote a lot those days and i knew what i know my writing skills sucks. glad i have some guy to help me. final, i finished those crap, I can not believe some parts of those paper are written by me.</li>
<li>besides writing papers, I went around, hand in papers to different people, get their signature. even printed the paper.</li>
<li>A teacher call me everyday around 9 am to wake up and go to he office, to write.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Team Leader</h3>

<ul>
<li>i don&#8217;t like this title, but i did have those title in some document files. since i talked to the guys in the team, i have to think and assigned tasks about we need to do at this point and future as well to them, based on their skills, attitute and motivation. i think i am doing ok, hoping they will do the same:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Developer</h3>

<ul>
<li>yeah, that&#8217;s what i love most, luckily i found i need some simple but basic feature/service but it didn&#8217;t exist. so i write a script to get it done and i am using it on a daily basis. of course i open source of this project at <strong><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">github The Backup-Box</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">The Backup-Box </a> it can sync/backup you files using the services provided by stuffs like dropbox, google drive, amazon cloud but offers a feature that allowed you to select any files on your machine and get it backed up, <strong>you don&#8217;t have to manually put those files into the directory in the cloud drive</strong></li>
<li>yesterday i found the first version code of hub looks ugly and seems confuse, so i rewrite most of them, it now looks much like my code:)</li>
<li>i start to take license seriously, so i chose <em>MIT Open Source License</em> to publish bub.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Student</h3>

<ul>
<li>i went to a Linux class in school, but i ran off in less than ten minutes.because i don&#8217;t find any nice girl in the classroom.</li>
<li>kidding, i got other stuff to take care of at that time.</li>
<li>kidding, again. if there is nice girl in the classroom, that &#8216;other stuff&#8217; can certainly wait another hour:)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Some other stuffs</h2>

<ul>
<li>i am glad i still stay in the campus and did&#8217;t want to <strong>quit</strong> again. this is a quit week and i don&#8217;t really enjoy this kind of busy, it&#8217;s not what i want. i just want to do <strong>my thing</strong> and get it done perfectly.</li>
<li>i don&#8217;t even got time to swim, but i got time to swim and writing blog today, it feels great. i am making progress in the pool.</li>
<li>i watched a great movie called <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/"><em>waiting alone</em> (<strong>http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/</strong>)</a> , i found it just like a mirror to me and i just found my <strong>Liu Rong</strong> in my life, or maybe i knew it for quite a while but afraid to admit it? god, i wish i can watch this movie earlier.</li>
<li>i will watch another great movie <em>Django Unchained</em> this week. i should watch it earlier but just too busy this week, now that i got time, i will watch it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Something is missing ?</h2>

<p>nope:)
good night and wish me luck.</p>

<p>因为ungetc的原因，代码请用gcc编译vc/vs对ungetc的处理不很好。</p>

<p>fo2_bug就是2b的字符串反转函数,把字符串ins反转之后存到outs.在main调用fo2_bug之后。会有点异想不到的事情花生～～</p>

<p>有同学说说fo2_bug这个函数的bug在哪儿，bug的症状是啥，为什么会出现bug&#8230;怎么fix就随便吧，太轻松了～</p>

<p>答对的女同学我请吃饭吧..</p>

<p>男同学，嗯。。送一个月高速PROXY或者迅雷会员吧&#8230;.<sup>^</sup></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hi, there.
yeah, i am gonna turn 0x17 tomorrow, that&#8217;s another whole new year for me and i think i just end my time in 0x16.
after reading my last year&#8217;s post, the theme of my 0x16 is &#8216;trying hard to be a guy that deserves you&#8217; , i think i failed, but i will continue to do so in my upcoming 0x17 times :)</p>

<p><strong>I failed to win her heart :&lt;</strong></p>

<p>but anyway, my 0x16 times turned out to be good. i got a nice job in the early year, i learned a lot from those awesome guys i met in the dev team and i gained a lot, i wish to be as good as them in the beginning. but in the end, i got acknowledged by them. it&#8217;s not easy, but it&#8217;s quite a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong>I really enjoyed thoses times in beijing, writing codes and getting paid and having tons of fun with new friends</strong></p>

<p>then, i quit that job and got back to school, plan to having some normal college student&#8217;s life. that&#8217;s, mostly a serious relationship with someone i like.</p>

<p><strong>I need some motivation to be excellent againn</strong></p>

<p>Also, this year, the main reason of me quitting the job and getting back to schol is, i really really want some <em>changes</em>, though i don&#8217;t know what that is, but it will come eventually, right?</p>

<p><strong>I already made some of those, namely from user-friendly linux distribution to a more flexible one, from linux to OS X, from vim to emacs, etc</strong></p>

<p>I think this year will be awesome, and i&#8217;d love to take all the challenges and opportunity in the upcoming days.</p>

<p><strong>i will do more sports!</strong></p>

<p><strong>happy birthday and good luck for whatever that is.</strong></p>

<p>END OF 0x16.</p>
