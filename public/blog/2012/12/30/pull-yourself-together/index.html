<p>Yes, i am writing this blog using <strong>EMACS</strong>, the ultimate text editor, i am so umfamiliar with it right now, but, i am getting better:)</p>

<p>A lot stuffs going on lately, i&#8217;ve been weighed the pros and cons about some certain things for quite a long time.
But now, I don&#8217;t think i will <strong>LOST</strong> again, because i believe i made the right decision, just like the one i made in 2010.
With no regrets but only excitement. I know this will become all new to me, since i regain my love for this university, which i&#8217;ve called it CRAPLAND for so long. I am really looking forward to what is happening next, i bet you will, too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Career</p>

<p>  The first and foremost one is about my intern, or i&#8217;d prefer to called it <strong>career</strong> :)</p>

<p>  I decided to <strong>quit</strong>, if school not kick me out right now.</p>

<p>  I love my development team, my leader and brothers. yeah, we&#8217;ve became really really close friends!</p>

<p>  I love what i do and what i will do if i remain stay there, that&#8217;s something i wish i could get hands on in a year ago, and i finally get the chance to play with it. the Amazing linux kernel, filesystem, and Networking stuffs.
And i will definitely take that offer if i got it six month ago, i wanted to write some serious code back then, besides the payment is good.</p>

<p>  but, everything has a beginning has an end, that&#8217;s how things work and i can only accept it. Since, i am no longer the guy i was six month ago, i am <strong>less</strong> motivated, but i will change.</p>

<p>  That change will not happen if i stay in company, or Beijing. and a <strong>push</strong> just came in time, letting me easier to make the call.</p>

<p>  So, here i am, back to Tianjin and hopefully i can pull myself together soon.</p>

<p>  And, I am gonna thank those guy who along the way with me, helping me making the decisions, thank you!</p></li>
<li><p>Myself</p>

<p>  I wanted this subtitle as &#8216;Relationship&#8217; or something like that, but it&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s kinda a problem of mine and I have to deal with it very carefully and hopefully it turn out to be good.</p>

<p>  I really really miss her during the days i was in Beijing, just right after i finished the project in company, i keep thinking about her. i can help myself.</p>

<p>  luckily i got some chances to see her sometimes, those moments are wonderful and I want more.</p>

<p>  We use to hang out frequently and maybe that why i am always motivated back in the days i am in school, it&#8217;s a huge lose if i can not have that anymore:(</p>

<p>  We had pizza at <strong>pizzahut</strong> last night, and walked in the snow, talking and laughing about her exs and some of my awkward stories. for quite a long i always thought we&#8217;ve never went out on rain or something like that, but this time we got snow, white, pretty snow. so, overall it&#8217;s feels nice! I never walk with a girl in the snow, so, luckily me, for i picked the right day. but, i was planed to buy her something, just like the story we talked earlier, it&#8217;s about a couple in a shop, the boy buy girl a cloth while she is trying it in changing room, and after she came out, the boy ask the girl to run, like escape and steal that cloth. yeah, i actually planned to do that, but.. we didn&#8217;t find a nice shop yesterday night:(</p>

<ul>
<li>NOTES

<ol>
<li><p>Our first official date was go to the movie, after we brought the tickets, i suggested we eat at pizzahut nearby the theater, but then she wanted to eat at a cheaper restaurant &#8220;yoshinoya&#8221;. at that time i thought maybe she don&#8217;t want me to spend too much money on our first date, but it just turned out that she is just <strong>simply</strong> don&#8217;t like pizzahut:(</p></li>
<li><p>That movie is total crap, we were all confused about that movies.</p></li>
<li><p>I still keep those tickets. the <strong>only</strong> movie we watch together.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought she loves going to the movies, in fact, she doesn&#8217;t and i, ask her to movies for like thousand times.. silly me!!</p></li>
<li><p>I asked her to movie again, TODAY.. dumb, no wonder her dump you in the first place. :(:(</p></li>
<li><p>NOTES above shows I need to get to know her more!</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>  but, the sad part is, i don&#8217;t know when we can meet again and this is really bothering me. i didn&#8217;t cherish the time we had before and took it for grant for so long. anyway, new year is about to come and i will post later.</p></li>
</ul>
