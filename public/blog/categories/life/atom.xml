<p>So, I am doing alright now. but a lot of stuffs going on those days and <strong>i will write a long post util I became "idle" again</strong> i promise.</p>

<p>As you can see, in this blog's left panel, there's a <strong><a href="http://sunuslee.github.com">new link</a></strong> called <strong><a href="http://sunuslee.github.com">Blog for coding</a></strong>. and it's my new blog for codes. I started it from October, 2013.Mostly, i did that blog for codes is because i want to keep a track of what i learn and what i've made during the process of coding.</p>

<p>It could be good for me. and it looks AWESOME with a cool domain:)</p>
