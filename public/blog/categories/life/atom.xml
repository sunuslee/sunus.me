    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong> Long time no see </strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hi, there! First of all, happy new year to you and wish you all have a wonderful new year, i give you my very best wishes here:)
Yeah, i did quit my job last year and had theses about 40 days of <strong>AWESOME</strong> holidays in my hometown with my family and friends which is fun and happy. We went to couple of places with views, of course, i took some photos, too. But most of those photos are mountains and some kind of <strong>vulgar</strong> pictures. LOL</p></li>
<li><p>Besides of having fun, i got my MacBook, it's a whole new user experiences, which i can not tell it's better that Linux or not. but compare to Windows. it's definitely a piece of work. Windows sucks, i said it to all the people i care about! :) I am getting used to OS X and i think it's more comfortable to develop some <strong>app</strong> on that machine than my old laptop. But it's okay, i do Linux-related/python work on my old machine while i am also a newcomer of APP developing. i am getting my motivations back, it just feel much better that i want to and CAN code again!</p></li>
<li><p>Tomorrow i will fly back to school and i don't know what that is, i am leading some students to launch a <strong>OpenStack</strong> project in school, even though i don't think that will be too much difficult for me, given the current situation we have. but still, i will do the most major work. don't know it's good for me or not, just wait and see how it goes. Also, i want some nice <strong>girls</strong> who's interested in front-end to help me, i don't know if she exists in my school.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the same-old-boring topic, i can not stop thinking about her, i know she also had a great great time on holiday, she sure did! so, let's just hope she is still available. I even pray for that in a old temple. kidding! i didn't do that:) so, still, chances are slim but i still don't want to give up on this girl who had stolen my heart for months, in some point stolen my codes as well:&lt; hoping i can make this right. We didn't send a word to each other in this whole holiday and i am not sure if she still remember me or not. but, i had hard time picking gifts for her and lucky(or not?) enough, i got something gift picking advice from my friends and sisters. so, just wait and see if she like that or not.</p></li>
<li><p>I am Back and I miss you all! the new semester could be a interesting one, not because of the school or class but you and all the uncertain changes and opportunity i wanted for a while!!</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Making Changes</h4>

<p>Yes, i am writing this blog using <strong>EMACS</strong>, the ultimate text editor, i am so umfamiliar with it right now, but, i am getting better:)</p>

<p>A lot stuffs going on lately, i've been weighed the pros and cons about some certain things for quite a long time.
But now, I don't think i will <strong>LOST</strong> again, because i believe i made the right decision, just like the one i made in 2010.
With no regrets but only excitement. I know this will become all new to me, since i regain my love for this university, which i've called it CRAPLAND for so long. I am really looking forward to what is happening next, i bet you will, too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Career</p>

<p>  The first and foremost one is about my intern, or i'd prefer to called it <strong>career</strong> :)</p>

<p>  I decided to <strong>quit</strong>, if school not kick me out right now.</p>

<p>  I love my development team, my leader and brothers. yeah, we've became really really close friends!</p>

<p>  I love what i do and what i will do if i remain stay there, that's something i wish i could get hands on in a year ago, and i finally get the chance to play with it. the Amazing linux kernel, filesystem, and Networking stuffs.
And i will definitely take that offer if i got it six month ago, i wanted to write some serious code back then, besides the payment is good.</p>

<p>  but, everything has a beginning has an end, that's how things work and i can only accept it. Since, i am no longer the guy i was six month ago, i am <strong>less</strong> motivated, but i will change.</p>

<p>  That change will not happen if i stay in company, or Beijing. and a <strong>push</strong> just came in time, letting me easier to make the call.</p>

<p>  So, here i am, back to Tianjin and hopefully i can pull myself together soon.</p>

<p>  And, I am gonna thank those guy who along the way with me, helping me making the decisions, thank you!</p></li>
<li><p>Myself</p>

<p>  I wanted this subtitle as 'Relationship' or something like that, but it's okay, it's kinda a problem of mine and I have to deal with it very carefully and hopefully it turn out to be good.</p>

<p>  I really really miss her during the days i was in Beijing, just right after i finished the project in company, i keep thinking about her. i can help myself.</p>

<p>  luckily i got some chances to see her sometimes, those moments are wonderful and I want more.</p>

<p>  We use to hang out frequently and maybe that why i am always motivated back in the days i am in school, it's a huge lose if i can not have that anymore:(</p>

<p>  We had pizza at <strong>pizzahut</strong> last night, and walked in the snow, talking and laughing about her exs and some of my awkward stories. for quite a long i always thought we've never went out on rain or something like that, but this time we got snow, white, pretty snow. so, overall it's feels nice! I never walk with a girl in the snow, so, luckily me, for i picked the right day. but, i was planed to buy her something, just like the story we talked earlier, it's about a couple in a shop, the boy buy girl a cloth while she is trying it in changing room, and after she came out, the boy ask the girl to run, like escape and steal that cloth. yeah, i actually planned to do that, but.. we didn't find a nice shop yesterday night:(</p>

<ul>
<li>NOTES

<ol>
<li><p>Our first official date was go to the movie, after we brought the tickets, i suggested we eat at pizzahut nearby the theater, but then she wanted to eat at a cheaper restaurant "yoshinoya". at that time i thought maybe she don't want me to spend too much money on our first date, but it just turned out that she is just <strong>simply</strong> don't like pizzahut:(</p></li>
<li><p>That movie is total crap, we were all confused about that movies.</p></li>
<li><p>I still keep those tickets. the <strong>only</strong> movie we watch together.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought she loves going to the movies, in fact, she doesn't and i, ask her to movies for like thousand times.. silly me!!</p></li>
<li><p>I asked her to movie again, TODAY.. dumb, no wonder her dump you in the first place. :(:(</p></li>
<li><p>NOTES above shows I need to get to know her more!</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>  but, the sad part is, i don't know when we can meet again and this is really bothering me. i didn't cherish the time we had before and took it for grant for so long. anyway, new year is about to come and i will post later.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>God! I Love School, It Feels so good!</h3>

<h2>End of my first EMACS POST, there will be more</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>humm, i feel like i am not young anymore. but, i am still doing those 'young people' stuffs that i really really feel some kinda ashamed of. so, it's time to grow up. in fact, i know i am growing up with time goes by.
in this very moment, right before i turn to 0x16, i would like to post something, something that i wanted to say several days ago.
first of all, i am so grateful for my family for they gave me a very very nice childhood. even though sometimes i felt it just not enough, but deep down in my heart, i knew they did what they could and i will always grateful for what they've gave to me. i just love to have them around me!
second, i'd like to thank all of my friends, for the time we spent together, for the happiness and sadness we shared. i'm really really proud of having you guys. I will do everything i can to make you feel the same way as i do, that is, i am hoping one day, you will feel proud of having me as your friend.
one last thing, i also want to end this with something suddenly came up of my head several days ago,  to my family,  friends and the ones i love:</p>

<p>i am trying hard to to a guy that deserves you.</p>

<p>because you are just so AMAZING.</p>

<p>hope i will not let you guys down before i turn to 0x17.</p>

<p>good night:)</p>

<p>END OF 0x15.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>hi, i've got a busy week, and i still got a lot of codes to write and i am happy that i still got something to do.
the project tmenny is about to launch and my resume-generator is almost finished. in the very beginning,  i was about to write it in ruby,which i just learned those days. but quickly i found out i might do this in the language i love most, that is, C. so,i wrote so much more lines of codes than ruby/python but i love the way C codes works. simple, clear and fast. and i can figure out almost what is going on under the every line of codes.that is just feels good!</p>

<p>humm, i really miss the days when we ACTUALLY hang out together last semester. sometime i don't feel the same way
as we're in school while i teach you some programming stuffs or just walk with you,strange.
even though i met someone new and we had great time, still i would rather going out taking 951 with you.</p>

<p>SK failed again and some of my really good friends are going to leave this school, including the one i just met, which is pretty sad for my to accept.</p>

<p>i am not quite quitting counter-strike yet, as we haven't been 'actually' 'hang out' lately, it's fun playing counter-strike on lan. but if i got chance hanging out with you, i will definitely pick you for sure. it's just 10 times fun than just playing game with nine guys :&lt;</p>

<p>hoping i can getting in 951 soon.
good night, gotta code tomorrow.</p>
