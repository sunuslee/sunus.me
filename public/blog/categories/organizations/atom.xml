The fresh start for any moment is available,so,i pick it up atÂ  once.<br/>
Over a period of two weeks or so,i got totally failed.whatevre study or emotion,frankly,i did want to set them right,but the effeort i made far from it's needed.Then i didn't take actions in response to fix them,and Let them act of their owe accord.<br/>
It's best that emotion comes of her own accord but STUDY.<br/>
when exams towards,i did something that should have done in earier days.Absolutely it doesn work.<br/>
Now,it's a TOUGH time i have to meet.but i have never been afraid of it.soon or later,i can win,i'm born winner.<br/>
i am superb,but a little lazy in doing memorization works,As well as careless.<br/>
It was the reasons why i failed.And sometimes i loaded with anxieties.<br/>
But i am a student,i have to lead a STUDENT-STYLE life.<br/>
As a reault of above all,the highest-emergencies is do what i plan to do and plan what gonna to do.<br/>
with a stone's far,i can easily get it.<br/>
let's see what will happen.</p>
