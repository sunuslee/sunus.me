	<div class="entry-content"><p>um&#8230; kind of feel down today and i just don&#8217;t know why.</p>

<p>lol this semester is about to finish, and i don&#8217;t know if i meet my goal that i had for this semester. no ! i know i am far away meet my goal this semester, i kind of feel frustrated about myself. didn&#8217;t do i write any popular stuffs , btw i mean the &#8216;DBCI&#8217; here, even thought there&#8217;s a few people who like it and found it interesting ,  anyway, i will NOT give up on my first project before i know how far / bigger it will get.  i decided to REFINE during my vacation.</p>

<p>i came up with a great idea several days ago, and i found my partner. so we decide to lunch this project right after we finished our exams. hopefully, my second project will do better. and i think, at least i wanna that stuff, and there is a lot of people out there who can not write codes, will need that too.</p>

<p>i had been put my most attentions on programming and internship lately, besides those stuff i really really had a very great time with a new girl i met here,  and she is the most AWESOME 18-year-old girl i know, even thought she doesn&#8217;t like to go to cinema or play billiards. i don&#8217;t know weather i will find someone else to hang out with when i just wanna see a movie or something when i have chance. i really really don&#8217;t know that either.  oh, by the way, she is gonna learn some C skills to take a exam,  i think i somehow &#8216;encourage&#8217;  her a little bit to do so.  anyway, hope she will find something interesting / beautiful in C , during the learning process.</p>

<p>i talked a lot with my friends lately,  i found that the older i get, the more i needs them and i feel very lucky to have them around, especially right now when i feel down, my best friend , still out there chatting with me, while i am writing this post.</p>

<p>i think i am kinda weird guy, i somehow will think a lot about the girl i hang out with recently, but when we lost touch one day and several days goes by. i might just forget about her and start to looking for new one.</p>

<p>i just don&#8217;t know what i am looking for. Or i just afraid to deal with the fact that i found what i am looking for,BUT i just don&#8217;t know if i deserve this ? i don&#8217;t know..</p>

<p>i wrote so many &#8216;i don&#8217;t know&#8217; in this post, i don&#8217;t know why&#8230;</p>

<p>so, good luck and happy x-mas and new year, it&#8217;s coming soon!</p>
