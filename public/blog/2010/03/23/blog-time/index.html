	<h1 class="title">BLOG TIME !</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>I usually do not feeling once i got interrupt by noise or something like that during the sleep. That really sucks and therefore i don&#8217;t talk to them for two or three hours ! This time , There&#8217;s not any communications as usual , but i am kind of happy for some certain reasons.<br/>
First of all , i finalized the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm as well as the failure function within it and i do feel happy about it. and i also felt that the KMP was a sign or hint for me , like quicksort or Hanoi or anything else that&#8217;s just AMAZING and EFFICIENT stuffs to tell me &#8220;hey dude ! since you have already got me , why don&#8217;t you go father to find more , to acquire more ?&#8221; yep, that&#8217;s what i do . and the more i explore , the more i need to know&#8230; but still , In the chasing of something you love , you gotta get well prepared of that.<br/>
OK,let&#8217;s move on. i always consider myself as a luck one.just like i finalized the kmp , i got at least two rewards . and yeah, both of them are wonderful and i just post it in time sequence.</p>

<p>The first one is i got a message that asked me whether i had dinner or not and at the beginning i don&#8217;t really notice that. but after two or three minutes , i figured , even a rock might also realized that she&#8217;s asking me out ! and soon as we met , i also realized that she might want to something outside the school , so alright then we got to a Korean barbecue . food&#8217;s great and i admit that i have not taste it yet. so , it&#8217;s great but it didn&#8217;t fill me up ? :D<br/>
during the dinner , we talked over a couple of topics including school life , movies , plans for the future , human natures ( kind of weird , but i still think i am the good one ) and so on. so , it has been great fun when having dinner with she. and when nothing&#8217;s left on the table that&#8217;s still available to eat,we checked out and headed back to campus.</p>

<p>Good things never came alone . when i got back to my dormitory i started to browsing people&#8217;s IM status,due to i just finished the kmp , and i found a target who is suffering from the ice cream that caused her feel pain.so , remember it seems like we didn&#8217;t talk much except some smile face since she decided not to visit me due to the AIESEC team discipline or something i don&#8217;t know. so , i sent &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with you and are you feeling super hot so that you must get some ice cream during the cold season.?&#8221; so it turned out to be a good starter , and conversation began, later on i showed off a little bit that i got a girl with me to dinner and how yummy the food was. all of a sudden , I got a message “i am going to sneak out to meet you !” then , i don&#8217;t get the time to think of what just happened , not to mention how to respond it properly. because another message came instantly &#8220;i got a C problem&#8221; blah blah blah&#8230; or,maybe i should have reply something like alright then . or you’re very welcome! :D</p>

<p>the class goes on and my phone is dying. so i just make it last as long as it can.</p>

<p>Turning to twenty means a lot of to me . there&#8217;s something big coming down in the near future that is the first important decision that i have ever made for my own path. Now i just need to prove that&#8217;s the right thing to do !</p>

<p>Bye!</p>
