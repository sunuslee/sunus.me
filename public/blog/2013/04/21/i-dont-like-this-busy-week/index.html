	<div class="entry-content"><p>hi, it&#8217;s been a while:) i just had some busy weeks and finally, i think i can take a break now. i can spend more time with friends and my personal work, plus some go on dates, if i am <strong>luckily</strong> enough.</p>

<p>i had been playing multiply roles for some weeks.</p>

<h3>System Administrator</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since the data on our servers got destroyed by mistake, i have to do that form scratch and got some new problems, mostly because we now work at a new lab with different networking enviroment.  it took some extra work. and also i have to re-write and setup our team wiki pages. i think that wiki is important but some of the guys in the team didn&#8217;t think that way, fine. now i can say that with confident that i am fully qualified for a <strong>SA</strong> position:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>HR guy</h3>

<ul>
<li>All right, it&#8217;s not that <strong>official</strong>, but i do have some rights at this team right now, and i did have received some resumes and <strong>hire</strong> someone to do stuffs with us, LOL. hoping i hired the right guy. and i am still want people to work with us, see the recruiting ad here:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf" title="download os-recuriting.pdf">PDF version: http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo">HTML version: http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>i am waiting, join us soon:)</li>
</ul>


<h3><em>Talker</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what the fuck the <em>talker</em> is ? but i can explain what that is, i talked with some of the main members our this team, asked their thougths on this <strong>thing</strong> we are doing right now, what&#8217;re they thinking and what they want to do next. and their answer is just, let&#8217;s say, simple.</li>
<li>I used to have pretty high admire on them, and i used to think i can count on them. but right now, i think i have to re-consider those thoughts. obviously they have other pressing matters right now, i have no comment on this and i have no right to judge them. but, i have mine too, and it&#8217;s the main reason why i came back this year. it&#8217;s definitely <strong>NOT</strong> what we do right now. if you don&#8217;t have motivation or this s not interested to you any more, you can quit. because at this point, i just find out every one right now are replaceable, i can not see the quality/ability we need in you right now, but, i once think you have those.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Secretary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes, secretary. I wrote a lot those days and i knew what i know my writing skills sucks. glad i have some guy to help me. final, i finished those crap, I can not believe some parts of those paper are written by me.</li>
<li>besides writing papers, I went around, hand in papers to different people, get their signature. even printed the paper.</li>
<li>A teacher call me everyday around 9 am to wake up and go to he office, to write.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Team Leader</h3>

<ul>
<li>i don&#8217;t like this title, but i did have those title in some document files. since i talked to the guys in the team, i have to think and assigned tasks about we need to do at this point and future as well to them, based on their skills, attitute and motivation. i think i am doing ok, hoping they will do the same:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Developer</h3>

<ul>
<li>yeah, that&#8217;s what i love most, luckily i found i need some simple but basic feature/service but it didn&#8217;t exist. so i write a script to get it done and i am using it on a daily basis. of course i open source of this project at <strong><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">github The Backup-Box</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">The Backup-Box </a> it can sync/backup you files using the services provided by stuffs like dropbox, google drive, amazon cloud but offers a feature that allowed you to select any files on your machine and get it backed up, <strong>you don&#8217;t have to manually put those files into the directory in the cloud drive</strong></li>
<li>yesterday i found the first version code of hub looks ugly and seems confuse, so i rewrite most of them, it now looks much like my code:)</li>
<li>i start to take license seriously, so i chose <em>MIT Open Source License</em> to publish bub.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Student</h3>

<ul>
<li>i went to a Linux class in school, but i ran off in less than ten minutes.because i don&#8217;t find any nice girl in the classroom.</li>
<li>kidding, i got other stuff to take care of at that time.</li>
<li>kidding, again. if there is nice girl in the classroom, that &#8216;other stuff&#8217; can certainly wait another hour:)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Some other stuffs</h2>

<ul>
<li>i am glad i still stay in the campus and did&#8217;t want to <strong>quit</strong> again. this is a quit week and i don&#8217;t really enjoy this kind of busy, it&#8217;s not what i want. i just want to do <strong>my thing</strong> and get it done perfectly.</li>
<li>i don&#8217;t even got time to swim, but i got time to swim and writing blog today, it feels great. i am making progress in the pool.</li>
<li>i watched a great movie called <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/"><em>waiting alone</em> (<strong>http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/</strong>)</a> , i found it just like a mirror to me and i just found my <strong>Liu Rong</strong> in my life, or maybe i knew it for quite a while but afraid to admit it? god, i wish i can watch this movie earlier.</li>
<li>i will watch another great movie <em>Django Unchained</em> this week. i should watch it earlier but just too busy this week, now that i got time, i will watch it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Something is missing ?</h2>

<p>nope:)
good night and wish me luck.</p>
