<li><p>Hi, there! First of all, happy new year to you and wish you all have a wonderful new year, i give you my very best wishes here:)
Yeah, i did quit my job last year and had theses about 40 days of <strong>AWESOME</strong> holidays in my hometown with my family and friends which is fun and happy. We went to couple of places with views, of course, i took some photos, too. But most of those photos are mountains and some kind of <strong>vulgar</strong> pictures. LOL</p></li>
<li><p>Besides of having fun, i got my MacBook, it&#8217;s a whole new user experiences, which i can not tell it&#8217;s better that Linux or not. but compare to Windows. it&#8217;s definitely a piece of work. Windows sucks, i said it to all the people i care about! :) I am getting used to OS X and i think it&#8217;s more comfortable to develop some <strong>app</strong> on that machine than my old laptop. But it&#8217;s okay, i do Linux-related/python work on my old machine while i am also a newcomer of APP developing. i am getting my motivations back, it just feel much better that i want to and CAN code again!</p></li>
<li><p>Tomorrow i will fly back to school and i don&#8217;t know what that is, i am leading some students to launch a <strong>OpenStack</strong> project in school, even though i don&#8217;t think that will be too much difficult for me, given the current situation we have. but still, i will do the most major work. don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s good for me or not, just wait and see how it goes. Also, i want some nice <strong>girls</strong> who&#8217;s interested in front-end to help me, i don&#8217;t know if she exists in my school.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the same-old-boring topic, i can not stop thinking about her, i know she also had a great great time on holiday, she sure did! so, let&#8217;s just hope she is still available. I even pray for that in a old temple. kidding! i didn&#8217;t do that:) so, still, chances are slim but i still don&#8217;t want to give up on this girl who had stolen my heart for months, in some point stolen my codes as well:&lt; hoping i can make this right. We didn&#8217;t send a word to each other in this whole holiday and i am not sure if she still remember me or not. but, i had hard time picking gifts for her and lucky(or not?) enough, i got something gift picking advice from my friends and sisters. so, just wait and see if she like that or not.</p></li>
<li><p>I am Back and I miss you all! the new semester could be a interesting one, not because of the school or class but you and all the uncertain changes and opportunity i wanted for a while!!</p></li>
