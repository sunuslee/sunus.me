  <div class="entry-content"><p>  I don&#8217;t know somehow.The moment after i handed that paper with my signature i suddenly felt empty,helpless,etc.It&#8217;s like something,something that&#8217;s special or important to you, was taken away from you.And those feelings can never be foresaw before today,right now.</p>

<p>  It turns out that something i can&#8217;t let them go as freely as air.Friendships,kind of relationships things and so on just all came up to my mind then messed it all up.I had to force myself to accept the fact that something just won&#8217;t last as long as i wish,it&#8217;s going to come to an end sooner or later.But when i take a look at the bright side,new friends have to be met,new relationships will be built,Did i look forward to those fresh stuffs? Of course i did! But when it comes to real,it&#8217;s different.</p>

<p>   Besides,i got a feeling that i did have some advantages like choose the path i want to ,even the right to choose were GONE.Suddenly i felt like i am at the mercy of fate and there&#8217;s nothing i can do about it.Oh,damn it! It just annoys,bothers me too much!</p>

<p>     So,from this moment towards,i have got to keep myself occupied till the day i feel better,peaceful inside.Given the conditions like that,C is a good option and what&#8217;s more? I am loving it and i am dedicate for it.So,just get down to work! Hopefully,good luck and blessing will be around with me.</p>

<p>  over &#8216;n&#8217; out</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>yeah,as the title goes, Sunus&#8217; 12years elementary studying times is OFFICIALLY over. Now,it&#8217;s 4am,a middle night i just could not get into sleep.i was charged with tons of energy by that SMS. so i feel obliged to write something,something that i can release my real feelings.</p>

<p>    OK,Let&#8217;s begin with the challenges i have faced.Every time when i meet a new challenge,especially some big,important ones,I can not put the best of myself into it and eventually the results came with a surprise,a damn annoying  surprise just made things became a total mess.Then,something turned around.I began to find the good sides of the situations which seem rather bad in the first place.As a consequence of that kind of thing,i just GOT THROUGH those challenges with ACCEPTABLE final results. And time proved it for several times.Alright,then,Such is life,whether you struggle for a high level or go to hell.</p>

<p>     Then,I want talk about the good college.As we all know,A tons of challenges out there,the good ones,the bad ones,or the finest ones,etc.But it&#8217;s absolutely not the only way to success.Many people,great people made their names in the history,didn&#8217;t finish the college education.I put those examples on here just want to convey this very point that &#8220;Some people just meant to be somebody,No matter what college he gets in.&#8221; Besides,I said that do not only because I want to encourage myself but also encourage those who was bothered by the future or colleges or something like that.There must be a reason for you that why things went on like this,maybe,It&#8217;s god&#8217;s perfect plan? Believe me,It&#8217;s a path that towards something great,but you just did NOT see it thoroughly right now. hum,it&#8217;s 5.21 am,i feel a little tried.so i decide to get some sleep right away.Tomorrow is the another day and the SUMMER BREAK officially begins! Let&#8217;s rock!</p>

<p>      BTW,i will put that damn SMS on this blog as soon as everything settle down.so , just wait and see how lucky i am to got that fabulous scores:&lt;</p>

<p>Peace and out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>  yeah,finally. It&#8217;s settle down.<br/>
  The damn fucking exams are gone for at least three months.<br/>
  Now,I just finished that task,technologically,the result is not as good as i expected.But,however,i made it top 10000 among 300000 students.<br/>
  Looking back the old days,three years ago i came to a high school that is the best school in the city.Then high school life began. I got some brothers,I got crush on somebody,and I got dumped as well. I am totally fine with the fact that i am not as perfect as i want to,even though i did/do shine sometimes.As a matter of fact,A failure at exams does not fade one&#8217;s capabilities.Besides,i have to say that those who got good grades are deserved that,because It did call for hard-working and some kind of intelligence and unyielding struggle in the hell of classrooms. I did poor than them because i deserved what i got,too. <br/>
  Anyway,That&#8217;s just the end of the past and the beginning of the future,life still goes on and sunus will be strong enough to fact whatever happens.<br/>
  At the end of the day,the summer break is fabulous ! Enjoy it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>  Uhh,Its 25/03/09.The night before I turning to 19. Mr.Sunus,&#8217;who was born 26/03/1990,is warmly welcoming his 19th birthday by this blog,right here,right now:) a couple of weeks ago,i sat my mind to prepare a special birthday present for myself. In fact, the present wasn&#8217;t that special at all. A great performance at 3th whole city&#8217;s exams is one of the thing i wanted. I would definitely not put it as &#8220;everything i wanted&#8221; nor &#8220;the only thing i wanted&#8221;. I am not gone that far,nevertheless,i do count it.   Now,It seems like the present wasn&#8217;t as good as i expected,but,in some degrees,i still smell some scent that like a kind of present. If you want to get excellent,you are likely to be good. But if the getting qualified is what you want,you can possibly get out. Such is life,&#8221;the bitch who you can never dump&#8221;. I accept it,and struggle for a higher level in the next year.   <br/>
  In the end,thx those people around sunus,female and male,old and young,beautiful and ugly,etc. I love you!<br/>
Gooooooooooooood bye the 18-year-old sunus!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>  I came up with this idea that i needed a 4th English notebook on several days ago. In fact,I would rather call it &#8220;stupid log&#8221; than a regular notebook that i already have three. Due to the National colleges entrance exam,I have to grab every single point that i can possibly lose by bad luck or something .Even thought,I still can do it well without those points and far beyond average standard. But,some stupid mistakes that such as countable/uncountable words,strange expressions and grammar rules i will make are avoidable.As long as i keep recording them by myself in beautiful hand-writing.</p>

<p>  When it comes to hand-writhing,There is a lot of things  to talk about. Fabulous as my writhing skill is,it still didn&#8217;t satisfy judge&#8217;s requirement.Or in otherr word,when teacher,who teaches my English,reviewed my essays usually said that&#8221;Except your poor handwriting and some small mistakes,its a pretty good one ,etc.Finally,It always earned some extra points which won&#8217;t be counted at all.Because they,who judge my essays, like beautiful handwriting more than native expressions,they like easier sentences than complicated clause or some exactly accurate words that i thought a lot. It seems like ridiculous that a beautiful handwriting beats everything, Including those skills that most students didn&#8217;t and won&#8217;t have.In order to ACTIVATE those sentences, i will practise handwriting when i log those stupid mistakes. </p>

<p>  Last but not least,In case of i have nothing to review before exams take place,this stupid log finally showed up.  Hopefully it will work. Depend on those facts,I got this notebook and wrote this introduction. It&#8217;s pretty funny,uhh? </p>

<p>  Good Luck!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Btw,This stupid log with everything that within it will be auto-DESTORYED on 08/06/09. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>﻿uh,there&#8217;s something i would like to post.</p>

<p>first thing first,i got a grade on recent math exam which made many students dont get qualified.Regrading on my skills and historical scores,i cannot make this happen without yielding hardworking and hope.I got paid back finally.But,anyway,its a long fight to take.Lots of obstacles are out there,needed to be conquered. So,Just keep going.You deserve more than what its now!Mr sunus!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>all right,Here I am.<br/>
technically,I finished it in several days ago and kept on my laptop.now,it&#8217;s time to post.<br/>
by the way,due to the situation where i was in before,maybe it&#8217;s different from what it&#8217;s now.Or it would have remained the same until several minutes before i got i new message.<br/>
btw#2:<br/>
i am going to watch some movies now,so i just post what i have wrote before.If you want a new one,which is also interesting and complicated,just keep clicking the REFRESH button.It could be jump out any time:)</p>

<p>﻿Those things should be blogged,Though,its kinda complicated.  Well,a
tough week is gone,put that exams,which isn&#8217;t the point i wanna
do on my blog,aside . So,here comes the thing.A couple of weeks late,a
friendship that i thought would be long locked and remained in my mind
and hers -maybe- was BACK. It happened suddenly,even without a single
sign! So,on that very last vacation,we did have had a great time,which
i didn&#8217;t expect at all. Life isn&#8217;t suck all time,but sometimes,life is
changeable and make people screw things up. When we back to school on
the second time,Both of we were much relaxed than the first time ,which
with chocolates giving and teachers keeping us company: ) .its good. I
didn&#8217;t even think about how to cope this relationship. The very
sensitive period that those a few days after back to school came
again.I don&#8217;t think i can fully take the fact that watching she and her
male friend hanging out together. I asked myself &#8220;from scale one to
ten,how uncomfortable you were?&#8221; i picked 6 or 7,somehow.Then,a word
popped out,its JEALOUS! Am i jealous of her friends? I don&#8217;t
know,anyway,i cannot chase any girl right now.who cares whomever she
hangs out with? I do,without a significant reason.Complicated as it
is,i am going to figure that out.If i cannot handle this well.The
friendship that i care about may go,again. Also,the feelings that being
told about her friends&#8221;s stuff didn&#8217;t sweet at all,which i often did
that to others.So,i will try to avoid that happening. Finally,the
gay-friends statement turned out to be useless.What the hell is
so-called gayfriends relationship that beyond friendship. I just hope
that i wont get screwed up this time.I do care about you,but,how am i
suppose to do?</p>

<p>maybe,something comes around:):)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, its MY FIRST BLOG FOR SCHOOL ASSINGMENT. And, what the hell is that? I dunno.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Anyway, here we go:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The first one is about a phenomenon that parents drive their kids to school and back home. Meanwhile, some statistic had been given. Such as some views of support or object.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>First of all, every garden has weeds. There is no exception that a thing is absolutely right and l00% perfect. So I think the most reasonable reasons to picking up kids are safe and saving times. Also, it is comfortable and makes a bit of more time to communicate with their kids. To this point, I cannot totally favor. But it’s an acceptable one.</p>

<p> Besides, I don’t thinks it’s a good ideal for those who wand to make their kids turn into a independent person, which is far more important than a comfortable environment or something like that.</p>

<p>  All in all, I just hope that we kids can get more spaces and time to be a man who is strong in mind and body.  Who doesn’t?</p>

<p>=====================================================================</p>

<p>DONE, I don’t know how much words I have typed, but I am sure that I reached the limit ion even beyond it, whatever.</p>

<p>========</p>

<p>Here comes the second one:</p>

<p>Well, this assignment is about a boy and a girl. They are in a peak which can see the sun rises up. While they’re seeing the scenery of the nature, one of them may say: “look, the sun is rising now. But, eventually, it will go down. And tomorrow is another day. That’s how the world works, likes life. Our lives were filled with ups and downs. We have already aware of that clearly. However, sometimes, we cannot accept our mistakes or failures. We want badly to be in the top of the mountain all the time. But No one can make it happen as he wishes. Even though he is trying hard with all might he got, but he cannot keep moving on without an obstacle. What I am going to express here is one should realize a truth that everything has its own way to work, we cannot against</p>

Afterwards,i started thinking about those people around me,especially the olds.My grandparents,i can not imagine how much they love me,i appreciate them.I am thankful to them,but i realized that NOT MATTER WHAT I DID,DO,GOING TO DO CANONT ENOUGH RECIPROCATE THEM.However,i will try my best to make them happy and proud of me.I promise, right now.        okay,here&#8217;s another thing to post,i asked a gril out for movie,but,in fact,i just wanted to STAND HER UP,so,i texted that&#8221;hi,how are you?Wanna a movie with me? or something like that&#8230;.Then she accepted,but set a time that i have already to town.This afternoon,i afraid that what if i get screwed up?Omfg&#8230;Who knows.Btw,if only she didnt stand me up so many times,i wouldnt do this to reward she.lol  update#1 Back home now,but,maybe,i got screwed up&#8230;.</p>
