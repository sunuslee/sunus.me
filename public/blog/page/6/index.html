	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another boring day begins,i rushed to classroom and found myself a seat in the corner.Trying and struggling to focus on the class,unfortunately i failed doing so which brought me another break right in the class.At 10am when my first class about to came to an end i was woken by hunger. So,i just waited hungrily. Finally,i got myself some foods and go on taking my next class,English which i thought it should be programming instead.Hence,i didn&#8217;t take the books and i have time to write those sort of of meaningless stuffs. It all started with the boring classes begin,now teacher is asking questions a so while i am writing this,i also have got to prepare for the answer.It super sucks,besides i sitting right next the guy i don&#8217;t like very much.Just think about how long we&#8217;ve met each other and i already began to resent you.How pathetic ! And i hope you just do not bother me now and forever !</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s put those stupid things behind our back and talk something interesting.  As you know,i am famous for leading a OTAKU life,no societies,no group and party. For that reason,the first impression i gave to those people around is a internet-addicted guy who is poor at everything with weak strength.Don&#8217;t even think about i got some good skills in sports. So,consequently i proved them wrong and show them what the next generation of otaku guy is by action,which surely surprise them a lot.The most brilliant guy should be a most laid-back one. Kind of unbelievable,right?</p>

<p>LOL.. Latest update: the last class about to begin and i just wait as i usual do.There&#8217;s on thing always on my mind,which is about my flymate.I will post another blog to write it out.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2009/10/12/vacations-shortwait-for-next-oned/">Vacation’s Short,wait for Next one:D</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now,I can officially announce that i am DONE with this 10-days off . The vacation that’s filled with laughs , joy , eat , exhaustion , excitement and sadness.I’d like to thank everyone who made those days so wonderful. And above all,I thought,I may brought you all of those great things,too,expect the sadness one:D</p>

<p>Here,I’d like to share my happiness with you guys,especially those people that kept me company for many years.  </p>

<p>The vacation began with the Inter Extreme Master Chengdu kicking off.I could finally saw a counter-strike from start to closing ceremony.It never happen to me in my hometown because of my busy schedule or something that just bothered me from this,to kept me away from tournaments one after another.But,the sunus’s already out of town!So,he watch it in his place with a lots of snacks and drinks.It’s great to saw sk’s new line-up to be champion again.Those old school players such as walle,robban are still can do it.Depending on the fact that SK got their victory  after struggling for many months,I just think i also can do this,to make all of those big dreams come true.Who says a counter-striker player doesn’t have ambitions?</p>

<p>Then,three days passed away,I started to prepared for my visit to Beijing.Washing some clothes,and got everything’s ready.</p>

<p>Here come to the trip of Beijing,Thanks to wk who picked me up from Beijing station to the hotel.BTW,She’s got prank before she met me,lol. It’s a long and hard way to go,filled with sweat and lost.Though,The disaster was largely brought by Mr..sunus,the one extremely lack of a sense of direction. But still,sunus felt grateful for what you have done for me,without you i would definitely lost in Beijing as soon as i got off the train.Thank you,wk:D</p>

<p>Then,we meet Mrs..plane and her friends.Hanging out at streets,talking and laughing as usually.</p>

<p>The next day at Beijing was absolutely the most exhausted day i have ever had.Sleep at 2 or 3 am and got up before 5am.I just can’t believe i still can move and move fast.Then,wk called me wanted to cancel this event,watching the flag-rising ceremony.Allow me to add this ‘She is the only one that wanted me to do this’.So,I got up with tired and made my mind up to pay her back! To let her know how does it feel when one didn’t get a good sleep,and it proved me wrong.She just as energetic as she could be,maybe the Tian an men square just had her activated. But,anyways,It didn’t work me.To tell you guys a secret,she just could not make it before the flag rose up. lol,keep it under the table:D okay,back to what happened after the flag rose up,That day was the last day before all of the 花车 taken off.unlucky sunus,he’s quickly became a unprofessional photographer.”My mom was not as tough as you to deal with” i replied this for thousands time after she said how could you do this to me?! you are the worst photographer i have ever seen…….   But,still,i got to shoot  her with variety of poses all around the square.Can you do this? i can…. How energetic i was!</p>

<p>then,we’re headed for  798art district where considered as a paradise for artists.To mention that,during the time on the bus,she just fell asleep as usual while i had to stayed focus on what’s happening. Holyshit,How nice i am…lol.then,we got to the destination and started to enjoyed those paints and stuffs…btw,i bought some special gift you some of you,just keep waiting.Those who receive my gift are the people i like,and you guys mean a lot to me!In the end of the day,we went to have hot-pot,and back to hotel….. What happened that night,stays in where they are.Don’t ask,Don’t tell:D</p>

<p>There always has a lot to talk about before people getting apart,so i just watched them talk and have my drink.</p>

<p>Finally,I’m back to Tianjin.My life moves on….</p>

<p>That’s all,just stay tuned and have fun.</p>

<p>good luck &amp; peace</p>

		<p>Right now,It’s six minutes to 10pm while sunus,laying in his bed,writing this blog for you.For me,it’s a bit earlier than i expected  because there’s no more things to do.I mean,the packing stuffs.I thought it would be a long way to go but when i put my actions into the packing progress,it’s just as simple as it could be.The id card,student card,wallet filled with money and bank card,the only thing left is my laptop,but i can leave it to the morning,are all got in their position that’s my bag.Besides i prepare some clothing ,that’s all i have done this night.Sounds long but it’s short and simple when you finished it.</p>

<p>some of you guys may know that i will head for Beijing and stay for a few days,yeah,that date is tomorrow! i am so excited about it. With this event was put into my schedule in several days ago,i feel time flies just as fast as plane,now upcoming event is officially going to be LIVE!</p>

<p>i don’t know what else should i blog,so that’s that.have a sweet dream and take off!</p>

<p>peace! and stay tuned.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>     Now,right after the first class began i just feel this course isn&#8217;t for me at all. Besides i am here to write this just to give you my sincerity regret to you,the girl i hurt last night without being conscious of it, the girl i met on the airplane a month ago.Because i do value the friendships we&#8217;ve built and i do want it can goes on and on and on&#8230;.  First of all,please allow me to say it again &#8220;i am sorry&#8221;. I have said it for thousands times before,but still. Hopefully it will work this time after the second when you read it over .</p>

<p>       I should NOT put any of my personal judgement on you when i didn’t fully think it over,especially to those messages that may hurt your feelings and its not a excuse to simply say i just didn’t realize what i typed may hurt feelings. I am deeply sorry about that.  Then,i am kind of glad that you were mad at me,maybe you also value this friendship,too. Even though it&#8217;s not as much as i do. But i still grateful for that,not only because you pointed my shortcomings out but also your can totally spilled your anger on me,which kind of showed that you&#8217;re not longer considering me as a passenger or flymate :D Nevertheless,i still feel sorry for you and i am begging you for your forgiveness that from the deepest part of your heart. Please give me a second chance and i will do anything i can possibly do to fix the mistake i have ever made.</p>

<p>      Least but not least,apart from my sincerity regret,do you remember to help me fetch my stuffs that almost arrive here.   uhh,two classes almost come to an end but i still wanna to post something off the topic but it&#8217;s sort of related to our friendship. When i asked you to give me your number,you just gave me your qq with a poor excuse by saying your phone&#8217;s charge was overdue while your qq stayed logged in.</p>

<p>      Now,I can finally get you number and i can have chances to dial it one day,may I? Okay , class is almost over but my regret always alive till you forgive me.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yours sincerely.</p>

		<p>um,the lunch is good,though.but i just don’t like it. So,i quit,to finish this blog that it should have been finalized in the morning.</p>

<p>Back to the topic,as i glad that her little brother just didn’t get into the as university as i do or otherwise,i would have been considered as a litter brother,it sucks.</p>

<p>But,anyway it means nothing to me about how she treated me.i just think it’s fun,that’s all :D</p>

<p>Does ages really matters? i don’t know.Some people who have the same age as others just got lots of arguments while some people always sharing the same ideas and never feel like to have nothing to talk about.so,my answer is NOT!</p>

<p>Hopefully,i can prove it right.</p>

<p>okay,peace &amp; stay tuned , again</p>

<p>love you guys&lt;3</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now,it’s about 11am,while sunus has already got up for almost one or two hours,that’s say,he didn’t lie in on the Saturday.Kinda strange for him,isn’t it?</p>

<p>  Maybe,the only reason for this can’t-lie-in case is the military training that request we to get up before 6am and get everything’s ready and then get everything’s done within next 20minutes.It sucks.So,A sleep lasts for 7 or 8 hours for me Was absolutely not enough Now it has just become a feast for me.And i have no idea whether it’s good or not.Just let it be,i guess.</p>

<p>hum,above this is my opener for this least blog.We can finally go right straight to the things i wanted share with your guys that’s about my whole new university life @ TJPU.</p>

<p>First of all,the military training has came to an end which means we’re officially being a university student.It’s cool,actually.As far as i can see,there’s tons of free time to do the things you like and new people to meet,no more high-school-style.For me,to program stuffs also pretty interesting,I mean i just do not reach that level to programming software now,but i will,i definitely will as long as i keep my energy up and desire to achieve this dream.</p>

<p>Then,My dormitory also good for me,expect some litter collision.fortunately it’s none of my business.so i just wait and see what’s going on out there.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about another stuffs happened around the campus which is i met two girls within a half month.It’s a big break-through for my sociability compare with the past.hum,both of them are as wonderful as i expected before i finally met them,except one of them is kinda smaller than i saw on her <a href="mailto:profile@web.%20The">profile@web. The</a> other one is pretty old for me and that what she thought before we met.She treat me sometime like she is my sister. i think i will prove the simply fact that’s SHE IS WRONG. Though she’s got a brother as old as my and just didn’t get through the Nation College Examination to TJPU. That’s really,really  good ,i mean, i have no any judgement on him,i just glad we didn’t become classmate:d or i will definitely be treated like her brother.</p>

<p>Okay,i will go out for lunch with a couple of guys come from my province ,peace!</p>

<p>STAY TUNED! Love you!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>first of all,i arrived at the Guilin airport and  then got my boarding check it went smoothly. after that,i gave my dad a good bye and went to have security checked.During the check process,some funny moments came up.Firstly,When i went through that gate , the instrument began to alert with Beep—Beep&#8212; LOL!</p>

<p>Finally,It turned out to be my metallic buckle which led to all off this funny stuff. Besides,jdfjkadshfjkasdjgfsbafjIaslfjs.</p>

<p>In order to take a look at the sky,I found a seat right next to the windows.But it’s kinda boring if you stare at it for five or ten minutes.So i looked around,a mid-aged lady sits next to me,and a girl,my,as old as i am,sit in the same line with me.As far as i know,Both of us came from the same city and went to university.Most importantly,we will go to Tianjin-.-  It’s funny-,-</p>

<p>Ok,i am thinks some open line to catch up –,- LOLI</p>

<p>see you later:D</p>

		<p>Hi there! Now,i get my last one hour at home,oh damn it,it’s 3 minutes down..and time goes on as usual.</p>

<p>What you’re reading is my first blog i post via my new laptop,my first blog after i got in TJPU and Last one before i officially leave town where i lived for almost 19years and move out of house where i just found i love it so much. Nevertheless A man has got to explorer those place he’s never been and fight for a better future to prove his own unique value. So,i gotta STEP UP! i think i can do that,and i can  make another story just like “From zero to hero” :D</p>

<p>  Too many things happened those days,I experienced happiness times with my best friends and so sad moments.Overall,Its been a good memories i will never forget,i cherish those moments,i value what you guys said. And most importantly,I consider you as my best friend,I will and always think of you when i am filled with loneliness or happiness,i wanna share those feelings with you.that’s what best friends do.</p>

<p>   hum,half an hour gone,which means i just have 30minutes to go or i just write whatever i like till i take off. :D</p>

<p>  To tell you a secret just for my best friends.i did some kinda illegal stuff yesterday.If you wanna know the detail,call me ^^</p>

<p>Last a few words i feel like to say,i am good to go right now,Its hard for me,though.A whole new journey is about to start and i don’t care what in store for me.By far,for my eyes,Its happyvalley! i am coming,here i would like to give a special thanks to Mengqing Zhan.Its you that make this happen! Thank you!</p>

<p>Ok,let’s just say good bye and make a piece of room in your heart,I will never move out:> I promise.</p>
