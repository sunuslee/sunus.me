		<p>Department Overview (&#8220;The area&#8221;):</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s software engineers develop the next-generation
technologies for which we&#8217;ve become world-renowned. In addition to
revolutionizing search technology, we use our world-class programming
skills to innovate in a number of other areas as well. Our projects
include working on advanced information-retrieval algorithms, massive
scalability and storage solutions, and large-scale applications that
enrich the user experience. We also work extensively on networking
systems, advertising systems and complex transaction systems in
consumer applications.</p>

<p>Job Description (&#8220;The role&#8221;):</p>

<p>  Software Engineers have a passion for solving complex and interesting problems.</p>

<p>Google is much more than search, and our mission has much greater
scope. To handle information at the scale of the web requires ideas
from just about every area of computer science, including information
retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security,
data compression, user interface design, etc.</p>

<p>Engineers work on many projects that carry varying
responsibilities. Below are some examples of the diverse projects with
which you might be involved.</p>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>

<p>1.Write server-side code for web-based applications, create robust
high-volume production applications, and develop prototypes quickly.
You should also have a strong understanding of, and practical
experience with, Java web application development.</p>

<p>2.Build our platforms, systems and networking infrastructure
using your strong background in distributed systems, OS/kernel, network
system design, and large scale storage systems.</p>

<p>3.Build internal systems used by thousands of Googlers around the
world with your domain expertise in HR, Staffing, Legal, and all other
corporate functions.</p>

<p>4.Specialist domains: UI development with AJAX and similar
technologies, client application development for Windows/Mac (Chrome,
Toolbar, etc.), embedded systems and mobile apps (Android), developer
tools (IDEs, large-scale build systems, compilers),
internationalization.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<p>  1.BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or related technical discipline (or equivalent).</p>

<p>  2.A solid foundation in computer science, with strong competencies in data structures, algorithms, and software design.</p>

<p>  3.Extensive programming experience in C/C++ and/or Java (strong OO skills preferred).</p>

<p>  4.Several years of large systems software design and development experience, with extensive knowledge of Unix/Linux.</p>

<p>5.Coding skills in Python or Javascript/AJAX, database design and
SQL, and/or knowledge of TCP/IP and network programming are a plus.</p>

<p>  6.Fluency in English (reading and writing).</p>

<p>Hopefully&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s getting boring now,i kind of wonder why it seems like everyone in this room are really into the class while i just don&#8217;t know what to do and write this blog on my cellphone&#8230;In fact,i was planning to read a novel called &#8221;crazy programmer&#8217;,but,now sitting right next to two girls who always giggle all the time since i asked is this seat available,i don&#8217;t wanna act as a bad guy or something like that so i keep my fingers moving which indicates i am doing something else other than reading meaningless online novels.By the way,The crazy programmer is really worth-reading and a must for me,i think. </p>

<p>Since the class is absolutely  humdrum as usual though,posting something interesting would be good.Seemingly i didn&#8217;t remember anything fun or interesting except coding,which takes most of my time,even class.When it comes to class,i am just unfortunate or destined to be that.Skipping happens all the class but every time i do so,the god damn teachers take attendance.What the heck? Fine,i will figure out a way to getaway.Sigh.,</p>

<p>The class carries on,so does my writing process.Heading to Beijing tomorrow kind of exciting,particularly when thinking about the meat,all night movies on and some unpredictable stand-ups.You&#8217;d better cut that minds off your head!</p>

<p>And what&#8217;s more,it&#8217;s a bit of cold out there,i updated my QQ status as below&#8221;Show me your hands,I&#8217;ll warm it up&#8221;,There&#8217;s a certain name hidden in it&#8230;And it&#8217;s pretty catchy<sup>^</sup> Hoping the one can at least say something to me,please. </p>

<p>Suddenly,One more thing pop up on my schedule，that is,CET4 EXAM,which i thought it&#8217;s a piece of cake for me. But,no give no gain.At least i should do something to prepare it.And class finally came to an end.</p>

<p>That’s a a mess-four-paragraph blog,hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>peace:D</p>

		<p>In fact,i should have given this presentation without paper,which is strongly recommended by teacher.and i will explain why right after.<br/>
My topic is several pieces of thoughts that occurred to me since i came here,please notice that what you are going to to hear are just thoughts,not advice.ok?<br/>
The first one is,Being sick really sucks,especially when you&#8217;re alone.Take me as an example,I gotta go to the clinic to have injections for severval times and in case of any bad illness happen to me,i still had to got to hospital that is located in downtown,where has the facilities to give me a full-scan,and fortunately,it&#8217;s just normal diseases,But still,hurt me a lot!Besides,During those days i was sick,It had became extremely hard for me to take good care of myself.Eventually,everything is going toward the best and I can have class as usual.But you know what this disaster leave to me? Endless catching-up stuffs and Countless times that wasted with it,what is worse, I just watched it ,then let it happened and there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it except sleeping and taking medicine. So that&#8217;s why i am giving this presentation with a paper,i did not have to recite it,with the workload i have right now,which is already heavier than usual.So,do be carefully with your body that will keep you company for the lifetime.they are precious and priceless.<br/>
Sorry for the healthy part that&#8217;s too long to listen,i will make rest of them as short as possible.<br/>
Second one,i realized that if someone just don&#8217;t have what it takes to do what he&#8217;s doing right now,then quit and never try it any longer.Because this word”try” refers to unsuccessful in dictionary.That means,no matter how hard you try,you will never get there.So,just go find anything else that fits you perfectly and devote all of yourself into it before you still can and still young. <br/>
Third,A lot of disposable time out there that is needed to be managed properly instead of doing what you want at that moment or even worse,sleeping or simply having fun,so please stop doing those stupid things.Time&#8217;s tight and precious,we should cherish it.<br/>
Last but no least ,Out of stressful high school life just a sign of another whole new life that&#8217;s filled with more invisible pressure to come.All of us should be clearly aware of that before it&#8217;s too late.A fresh new start is university&#8217;s all about.Life’s short,go for it.<br/>
That all,thanks for listening.May you guys free from illness and sickness&#8230;</p>

		<p>All right here i am again,every single minutes of the English class is extremely as boring as hell. And thanks to that meaningless presentation i gotta to prepare ahead of time.You may ask questions like that&#8221;why the hell are you doing that,the sunus i knew never do those stuffs..&#8221;because i am like a kind of model here,and model should do things good&#8221; so,here comes my speech&#8230;      </p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2009/11/02/its-been-two-months/">It’s Been Two Months…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It’s been two months since i first met you in the plane.Time flies,right? Everything happened between us is just like a flash,yesterday we’re close and today saw that you’re gone.As a matter of fact,i wanted to invited you to dinner tonight and i planed it before we lost in touch.Don’t ask why,i don’t know,maybe i just wanted to spill out those things since there’s no one else can chat with,not to mention the “LiuPu”.I don’t know what’s on you mind,but that thing is as simple as it’s.</p>

<p>Yesterday,we’ve got a great deal of topics to chat about,and i remember the last topic is about movie,and i did watch <em>The graduate,</em>so that i could talk it if i could meet you some day.Without you,my life wasn’t changed that much,i had to take good care of myself as usual and i started to buy fruits thanks to the illness.Sometimes,Thinking about whether you’re busy or something took over my head but finally i can get rid of them in two or three minutes.You’re a person of ambitions,you’ve got a clear goal and know where headed for.That’s great,otherwise how i was possible to want you to be my friends ? And i wanna be yours,too. That day is approaching,but you will definitely do excellent job and get in wherever you want.You can pull it off and you will.Here i just give you my best wishes.</p>

<p>Today,01,11,what a magical day!It’s not only the two-months-away from home memorial but also took my illness away and brought me a whole new start.But sadly,i had dinner with someone else from my dormitory instead you:&lt; Anyway,Let it be,if fate wanna take you away from my life,then fine.Encountering in the plane wasn’t a coincidence whatsoever,so waiting for the turn between us.</p>

<p>You know what? yesterday i watched a movies and i saw a girl’s ways of looking at people and smile are just like you ,which fascinate me a lot,so i think about you again but without any further thoughts.Let’s take a look at those pictures:&lt;lol,for further information,contact me.></p>

<p> <a href="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/273efdfa8de77ee0fe979d8f5e877bbc.jpg"><img src="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/273efdfa8de77ee0fe979d8f5e877bbc.jpg?w=300" alt="" /></a><a href="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1f1559701cab4168a45bf7a7f68ee106.jpg"><img src="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1f1559701cab4168a45bf7a7f68ee106.jpg?w=300" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c817a90c03f514d2be8c84b07e45bd29.jpg"><img src="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/c817a90c03f514d2be8c84b07e45bd29.jpg?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>That’s one of the elements i felt that makes you distinguish,So that i can recognize you among the crowd by this very smile.So,keep smiling,for yourself.  </p>

<p>see you, and have a nice day!</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2009/10/30/where-another-boring-day-begins/">Where Another Boring Day Begins</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another boring day begins,i rushed to classroom and found myself a seat in the corner.Trying and struggling to focus on the class,unfortunately i failed doing so which brought me another break right in the class.At 10am when my first class about to came to an end i was woken by hunger. So,i just waited hungrily. Finally,i got myself some foods and go on taking my next class,English which i thought it should be programming instead.Hence,i didn&#8217;t take the books and i have time to write those sort of of meaningless stuffs. It all started with the boring classes begin,now teacher is asking questions a so while i am writing this,i also have got to prepare for the answer.It super sucks,besides i sitting right next the guy i don&#8217;t like very much.Just think about how long we&#8217;ve met each other and i already began to resent you.How pathetic ! And i hope you just do not bother me now and forever !</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s put those stupid things behind our back and talk something interesting.  As you know,i am famous for leading a OTAKU life,no societies,no group and party. For that reason,the first impression i gave to those people around is a internet-addicted guy who is poor at everything with weak strength.Don&#8217;t even think about i got some good skills in sports. So,consequently i proved them wrong and show them what the next generation of otaku guy is by action,which surely surprise them a lot.The most brilliant guy should be a most laid-back one. Kind of unbelievable,right?</p>

<p>LOL.. Latest update: the last class about to begin and i just wait as i usual do.There&#8217;s on thing always on my mind,which is about my flymate.I will post another blog to write it out.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2009/10/12/vacations-shortwait-for-next-oned/">Vacation’s Short,wait for Next one:D</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now,I can officially announce that i am DONE with this 10-days off . The vacation that’s filled with laughs , joy , eat , exhaustion , excitement and sadness.I’d like to thank everyone who made those days so wonderful. And above all,I thought,I may brought you all of those great things,too,expect the sadness one:D</p>

<p>Here,I’d like to share my happiness with you guys,especially those people that kept me company for many years.  </p>

<p>The vacation began with the Inter Extreme Master Chengdu kicking off.I could finally saw a counter-strike from start to closing ceremony.It never happen to me in my hometown because of my busy schedule or something that just bothered me from this,to kept me away from tournaments one after another.But,the sunus’s already out of town!So,he watch it in his place with a lots of snacks and drinks.It’s great to saw sk’s new line-up to be champion again.Those old school players such as walle,robban are still can do it.Depending on the fact that SK got their victory  after struggling for many months,I just think i also can do this,to make all of those big dreams come true.Who says a counter-striker player doesn’t have ambitions?</p>

<p>Then,three days passed away,I started to prepared for my visit to Beijing.Washing some clothes,and got everything’s ready.</p>

<p>Here come to the trip of Beijing,Thanks to wk who picked me up from Beijing station to the hotel.BTW,She’s got prank before she met me,lol. It’s a long and hard way to go,filled with sweat and lost.Though,The disaster was largely brought by Mr..sunus,the one extremely lack of a sense of direction. But still,sunus felt grateful for what you have done for me,without you i would definitely lost in Beijing as soon as i got off the train.Thank you,wk:D</p>

<p>Then,we meet Mrs..plane and her friends.Hanging out at streets,talking and laughing as usually.</p>

<p>The next day at Beijing was absolutely the most exhausted day i have ever had.Sleep at 2 or 3 am and got up before 5am.I just can’t believe i still can move and move fast.Then,wk called me wanted to cancel this event,watching the flag-rising ceremony.Allow me to add this ‘She is the only one that wanted me to do this’.So,I got up with tired and made my mind up to pay her back! To let her know how does it feel when one didn’t get a good sleep,and it proved me wrong.She just as energetic as she could be,maybe the Tian an men square just had her activated. But,anyways,It didn’t work me.To tell you guys a secret,she just could not make it before the flag rose up. lol,keep it under the table:D okay,back to what happened after the flag rose up,That day was the last day before all of the 花车 taken off.unlucky sunus,he’s quickly became a unprofessional photographer.”My mom was not as tough as you to deal with” i replied this for thousands time after she said how could you do this to me?! you are the worst photographer i have ever seen…….   But,still,i got to shoot  her with variety of poses all around the square.Can you do this? i can…. How energetic i was!</p>

<p>then,we’re headed for  798art district where considered as a paradise for artists.To mention that,during the time on the bus,she just fell asleep as usual while i had to stayed focus on what’s happening. Holyshit,How nice i am…lol.then,we got to the destination and started to enjoyed those paints and stuffs…btw,i bought some special gift you some of you,just keep waiting.Those who receive my gift are the people i like,and you guys mean a lot to me!In the end of the day,we went to have hot-pot,and back to hotel….. What happened that night,stays in where they are.Don’t ask,Don’t tell:D</p>

<p>There always has a lot to talk about before people getting apart,so i just watched them talk and have my drink.</p>

<p>Finally,I’m back to Tianjin.My life moves on….</p>

<p>That’s all,just stay tuned and have fun.</p>

<p>good luck &amp; peace</p>

		<p>Right now,It’s six minutes to 10pm while sunus,laying in his bed,writing this blog for you.For me,it’s a bit earlier than i expected  because there’s no more things to do.I mean,the packing stuffs.I thought it would be a long way to go but when i put my actions into the packing progress,it’s just as simple as it could be.The id card,student card,wallet filled with money and bank card,the only thing left is my laptop,but i can leave it to the morning,are all got in their position that’s my bag.Besides i prepare some clothing ,that’s all i have done this night.Sounds long but it’s short and simple when you finished it.</p>

<p>some of you guys may know that i will head for Beijing and stay for a few days,yeah,that date is tomorrow! i am so excited about it. With this event was put into my schedule in several days ago,i feel time flies just as fast as plane,now upcoming event is officially going to be LIVE!</p>

<p>i don’t know what else should i blog,so that’s that.have a sweet dream and take off!</p>

<p>peace! and stay tuned.</p>
