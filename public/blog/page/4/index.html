		<p>um&#8230; kind of feel down today and i just don&#8217;t know why.</p>

<p>lol this semester is about to finish, and i don&#8217;t know if i meet my goal that i had for this semester. no ! i know i am far away meet my goal this semester, i kind of feel frustrated about myself. didn&#8217;t do i write any popular stuffs , btw i mean the &#8216;DBCI&#8217; here, even thought there&#8217;s a few people who like it and found it interesting ,  anyway, i will NOT give up on my first project before i know how far / bigger it will get.  i decided to REFINE during my vacation.</p>

<p>i came up with a great idea several days ago, and i found my partner. so we decide to lunch this project right after we finished our exams. hopefully, my second project will do better. and i think, at least i wanna that stuff, and there is a lot of people out there who can not write codes, will need that too.</p>

<p>i had been put my most attentions on programming and internship lately, besides those stuff i really really had a very great time with a new girl i met here,  and she is the most AWESOME 18-year-old girl i know, even thought she doesn&#8217;t like to go to cinema or play billiards. i don&#8217;t know weather i will find someone else to hang out with when i just wanna see a movie or something when i have chance. i really really don&#8217;t know that either.  oh, by the way, she is gonna learn some C skills to take a exam,  i think i somehow &#8216;encourage&#8217;  her a little bit to do so.  anyway, hope she will find something interesting / beautiful in C , during the learning process.</p>

<p>i talked a lot with my friends lately,  i found that the older i get, the more i needs them and i feel very lucky to have them around, especially right now when i feel down, my best friend , still out there chatting with me, while i am writing this post.</p>

<p>i think i am kinda weird guy, i somehow will think a lot about the girl i hang out with recently, but when we lost touch one day and several days goes by. i might just forget about her and start to looking for new one.</p>

<p>i just don&#8217;t know what i am looking for. Or i just afraid to deal with the fact that i found what i am looking for,BUT i just don&#8217;t know if i deserve this ? i don&#8217;t know..</p>

<p>i wrote so many &#8216;i don&#8217;t know&#8217; in this post, i don&#8217;t know why&#8230;</p>

<p>so, good luck and happy x-mas and new year, it&#8217;s coming soon!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hey hi, long time no see again it’s been busy months after I got here. I got here early but still got soooo much crap paper work to do.when I got all of those stuffs done. I suddenly felt like , oh god. why are you get back to this crap-land and why the hell did you gain after those days?</p>

<p>when those feeling gone, I just got some ideas to keep working on my APP,aka ‘DBCI’. so the DBCI and polo fulfilled my days a lot. now the &#8216;DBCI&#8217; , I think it’s kinda like my FIRST MAJOR PROJECT , the one that I think people will actually like, feel it interesting and use it sometime for a while. as I wrote in my resume, I want to writing something that people like, I didn’t realize that day just CAME, now I just need a partner to do some UI stuff and promote it a little bit. I think it could be huge!</p>

<p>besides ‘DBCI’, I met some interesting girls that I can hang out with,that’s is just GREAT. for a guy like me don’t usually go to class , don’t usually talk to girls that not familiar with before, is hard to find girls like I have right now to hang out with. I am not saying I am not interesting or funny or attractive. I just do know where my ‘in’ is.</p>

<p>and I really really want say thank to my best brothers in tjpu, I am so so honored to know you two, I will never forget your help when I got here alone!</p>

<p>I think that’s all ! this place sucks.but I still need to find a way out, to somewhere that I truly belonged to. peace, hope my ‘DBCI’ will grow up soon and have a nice day!</p>

<p>and i just had a really nice day with you.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A little tip:</p>

<p>If you are a guy , or you are NOT into me at all, you can just ignore this blog.</p>

<p>yeah, i figure i have to finished this post before i get going..</p>

<p>i said &#8220;i must get a serious girlfriends this semester!&#8221; some time ago to a friend , and i have some requirements for this very special girl.</p>

<p>First of all:</p>

<p>you MUST be gook-looking, i mean you can be cute, be beautiful,be attractive or sexy . that&#8217;s all right . if i ask you out  to a movie or dinner, that means I think she is GOOD-LOOKING to ME!</p>

<p>then, here comes the second stage, i want you to have some of these qualities list below :</p>

<p>(these are the ones that really matter to me, more important than your appearance)</p>

<p>0: don&#8217;t be evil.</p>

<p>1: thoughtful and considerate to others</p>

<p>2: have ability to think independently, have your own opinions</p>

<p>3: have good sense of humor</p>

<p>4: at least have basic computer skill, if you are a coder, programmer-to-be or computer science relevant major , that&#8217;s just great . if you like      writing programs/codes , or research in ALGORITHM, that&#8217;s just AWESOME!!!!!(i really mean it, that&#8217;s what a girl that i longing for days looks like) and i won&#8217;t repair your computer/phones for more than 3 TIMES!</p>

<p>5: love movies or American TV shows like:</p>

<p>[24, The big bang theory,  How i met your mother, Leverage,  It crowds,  Spartacus, Gossip girl and PORNS:D:D!!]</p>

<p>then we may have more topic to chat about.</p>

<p>6: knowing stuffs, like how two people to maintain their relationship, what can do and what can NOT do, that&#8217;s important especially when we</p>

<p>decided to start a relationship.</p>

<p>7: respect people&#8217;s privacy, that mean i will NEVER give out my IM account, Email account, Social Networks account, etc. and i won&#8217;t ask you</p>

<p>for these infos, neither.</p>

<p>8: if you are a Hardcore Counter-Strike player , polo beginner or a programmer/coder , that will SIGNIFICANTLY  increase my impression of you.</p>

<p>9:at lease understand what i wrote above , with or without the help of any kinds of TRANSLATOR. i know there&#8217;s a lot a grammar mistake inside this blog,  if you can point it out, i appreciate it</p>

<p>Lastly, please do keep this in mind:</p>

<p>if i ask you out to a movie or dinner for the FIRST time, it just , just means i think you are good-looking to me, nothing less, nothing more.It takes days to build up a serious relationship.</p>

<p>thanks  for reading this long piece-of-crap-blog-if-you-are-not-into-me lol</p>

<p>have a good day! sweetie!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I came up with this title a few days ago, that’s when I decided to write this post, to summary those extraordinary days.</p>

<p>Finally ! I get back to this damn school, continue my education , as I promised to my family.</p>

<p>It has been a long and tough journey , I’d been lonely , helpless , hesitating and sometimes lost.but now,I am still here and ready to fly there , then keep on fighting.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I did what I thought a year ago or I got what I thought I want a year ago, anyway it’s a tough year and I made it through. I did GAIN my skill a lot, including polo</p>

<p>I TRY to grab some opportunities , but when I mean I TRY, I think u may know what it ended. so, I get back in the game with nothing and a extra year, not good but wtf, I don’t give it a shit as always.</p>

<p>Meego , Youdao and Tencent I think you just made a BIG MISTAKES! anyway, I still like Meego!</p>

<p>Wired me! I suddenly feel like I have nothing to write about , except to give some really really BIG thanks to those wonderful people that keep me company through those days , you guys really really just wonderful and I can not thank you enough! I really enjoyed the times when we hung out together and I will NEVER forget you.</p>

<p>One more thing, just some days before I get back to Tianjin, I came up a VERY VERY COOOOL idea . I made it come into real codes and it just about to get started ! if you are a Douban.com member and wanna try something cool stuff, u can ask me to try this cool stuff before anyone else does. It’s a python program and now need someone to make it into a beautiful HTML page.</p>

<p>This is my first time I feel that I can really do something that is cool and people may like it.</p>

<p>Last, after this long journey, I think I really really need some girlfriend , so watch out ,girls ! I will soon post another blog about “What kind of girl that I will ask her out on a date”.</p>

<p>So, thanks for reading!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hummm&#8230;</p>

<p>Once again, no long time no update.</p>

<p>but this time is special , because i just send this blog&#8217;s address to a girl, a girl that i have crush on from 9.2010 to now. :D</p>

<p>ok, let&#8217;s get started!</p>

<p>first of all, it&#8217;s 4,may 2011 now. it&#8217;s been a while and i think now i feel kinda ready to embrace the new opportunities and challenges . hopefully u can see me in Shanghai in next few days.Wish me luck!</p>

<p>I think i really did work hard in the past few week , i wrote a c library with some common data structure and algorithms and it can handle all data types.</p>

<p>and i make a little &#8216;peer to peer&#8217;_chat tool named &#8220;talk2gals&#8221; , but now it can ONLY running on linux/unix Operating System now , because some portable issues. but it&#8217;s not that hard to make it run on windows as long as i find the girl who&#8217;s willing to use it to chat with me:D</p>

<p>I read so many books recently , i found them benefit me a lot ,i never felt i like reading book like this time before or let&#8217;s just say before i get in university.i can freely read the book i like for my own good rather that for those suck exams.</p>

<p>i just found my english-writing skill is kinda decaying.</p>

<p>so i just put a SONG that i really really love to listing those days :</p>

<p>Play on , Sung by Carrie UnderWood from her album Play On.</p>

<p><strong>[00:36.04]Where you&#8217;re gonna reach when the goal gets higher</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:38.53]How you&#8217;re gonna make it through</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:40.39]When you think you lost your chance</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:42.62]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:43.00]Play on when you&#8217;re losing the game</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:48.08]Play on &#8216;cause you&#8217;re gonna make mistakes</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:53.56]It&#8217;s always worth the sacrifice</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:56.79]Even when you think you&#8217;re wrong</strong></p>

<p><strong>[01:03.70]So play on&#8230;</strong></p>

<p><strong>here is a link for this GREAT HIT :</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://music.sina.com.cn/yueku/i/1234878.html"><strong>http://music.sina.com.cn/yueku/i/1234878.html</strong></a></p>

<p>ok,i hope u enjoy it and see you next time!my friends.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>when i got into high school,i wanted a reunion party with my elementary  school’s classmates. to see if they’re doing all right and i also wanted to show  what i’ve become during that days with them . and to tell them i will always  remember those guys walk all the way through six years and i TRULY appreciate  it!</p>

<p>when i got into the university , i waned a reunion party with them to.</p>

<p>In this very year,31st Jan,2011. My dream finally came true.We are finally  get back gathering together to do this REUNION stuff.</p>

<p>Girls are getting pretty than ever ! some of them i can still remember what&#8217;  they’re look like or sound like . maybe some of them will stay in my memory  forever,just like ROM ^<sup>.</sup> yeah,that’s true. It’s not embarrassing to said  that,’cause it has been years and just let the past pass.we all have moved  on!</p>

<p>Boy are getting mature.and we ‘re really having a great time @ party .  The beers didn’t waste a single drip:D</p>

<p>The only thing that i considered as a pity is that there’s a girl,a girl that  i really really want to have a talk with,did NOT show up:&lt;…. sigh,hoping  there’s always another chance out there for me . I just want to have a talk with  her,that’s it.</p>

<p>I am really having a great time this night and i love you all!</p>

<p>UPDATE: We are going to do it AGAIN! IT&#8217;S GONNA BE CRAZY! CAN’T WAIT TO SEE  U!</p>

		<p>hey hi,it&#8217;s been a while after the last post,i think i am doing all right those days , even though the progress was not as significant as i excepted. the more i learn , the more i need to learn .this is the most impressive thought i have ever got,but its ok to keep on going and fight for my future.My goals are remain the same , no matter how hard the code is, one day, i will eventually write my own software. <br/>
actually,i am on my way to Nanning right now,to meet a long-gone friends,that dude was my best friend in elementary school , we also played video games on weekends that was the purest joy at that time and i will never forget.i hope,we can be as close as the old days,like my other friends do. <br/>
here is another case , which ultimately leads to the trip to Nanning, i am going to meet a girl , a girl that sunus wants her to be smart,cute,and beautiful . sunus is always be the guy who can make girls feel happy with him. hopefully this nothing goes wrong. <br/>
we&#8217;ll have dinner,a new 3D thrilling movie as simple as that -.-Do not get me wrong. <br/>
cant wait to meet you guys and have a nice day.i am almost there! <br/>
Nov 17,2010</p>

<p> </p>

<p>UPDATE #1:</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After several month&#8217;s suffering,sunus is out of school as he wished and now he is on his way home,on the train. <br/>
finally,i made up my mind to get out of school to put everything i got to what i love for years , it wasn&#8217;t as tough as you thought . but it calls for courage and supports from all aspects to make it happen .luckily , i have them both ! so right now , it is my time to spark , to let the rest of the world know what i am doing and what exactly i am capable of . of course it is a long and tough way to go , but i firmly believe in myself as i always do . No matter how the world changes ,the future of mine is bright . so , i will just code my own future .</p>

<p>I got off the train , and i will get in the plane shortly.:D</p>

<p>so wish me luck!</p>

		<p>Hi there, it has been a while since last time I wrote blog directly on my laptop . Now i am not taking any of classes , of course its about one o’clock in the midnight ! But what i want to emphasize is that THIS blog means something to me, something that i have thought it over and over . So, i just spill it out with the rain falling down to the ground.</p>

<p>I always consider myself as one of the most OUTSTANDING guy in the campus who cherishes his time to do things that he like and matters to him. Of course that thing is always be the Programming,codes and datas for me. and i did do as i described above. But now,or more specifically , recently i spent so so so much time with girls and having fun. I don’t like the way i spent my time , because i didn’t come here to dating or hanging out with girls after all. I mean, i don’t blame any of the girls that i have met or played with. In fact , you guys are just wonderful,gorgeous and cute. Moreover some of you did attract me very much so that i just simply could not stop thinking of you for several days till i realized  you’re just a passerby in my life, or maybe not,who knows :D</p>

<p>Now , the rain just stopped but my fingers keep on typing :D</p>

<p>Despite the fact that lately i was with girls quite often , i still DO NOT think it do much harm to me . Because of that sort of shy , tacitly kid has gone,even though i don’t how far it’s , but still it’s good. Especially when i witnessed the whole progress of one of my friend’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend came to an end in such a few days, I finally realized how important it’s to know how to deal with girls,how to talk to them and so many how-to-do stuffs. I just did a better job than that tragedy roommate,So please don’t feel me like a date artist or some kind of expert or something. lol.Therefore,I just want to thank those girls i met early years,even though none of you is my girlfriend but it really really doesn’t matter at all ! i really really mean it .Your companionships are one of the most beautiful,valuable things i have ever got.  As a consequence, i bet my future girlfriend will thank you guys too,for you turn me into a nice,sweet,humors,thoughtful,considerate boyfriend,while is definitely more than qualified. (and so many adj(s) will be added long as i saw them)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to focus on what its most important to me,like i said,coding,programming and datas. That’s why i wrote this blog in such a late night, There&#8217;s something i want to be memorized while something i just want to get rid of. From now on,I will manage my times wisely and perfectly.First of all, Huffman Codes is about to come to an end.And the graph is a whole new chapter that’s to be taken care of.So, Since i have gone that far,why don’t i just go father ?</p>

<p>alright,it’s about two 2am but i think it’s worth posting a blog like this.Oh i almost forget there’s a English test tomorrow,but what the hell. I already proved myself is the BEST student in the class by the cet-4 test. i just do not have to do that thing again and again.</p>

<p>ONE LAST WORD :</p>

<p>SUNUS DE BEST!</p>

<p>good night and have a nice day :D</p>
