  <div class="entry-content"><p>hum,yeah,The first semester  is going to be over , and yeah , just like i said right after the Nation College Entrance Exams , “Life goes on , yeah , it does! ”</p>

<p>Back to last night,i lost sleep due to a problem i always think about recently “What’s all about going to a university ? Considering the fact that  my parents provide me with finance supplement and any other stuffs for ages.I still can’t take it for grant. ” i can’t do that ! “</p>

<p>So , last night , or last week , more specifically i feel like i like a idle people or something that i always despise . Because the least thing i like to do forced me to get into it all the week and i can’t even get rid of it.Why? It’s like a measure or aspect to evaluate whether i was doing good during the semester or not for them .  I got absolutely strongest feeling that i did this for none other then THEM. Who the heck are they ? I am not sure if it’s my mom,grandpa or someone else but it’s definitely neither Me nor my dad. However,I am the one who’s in university and also the one that makes the call to choice what kind of man i want to be, to decide what should i learn and what i don’t need to do at all . Now that , I have the answers to that , i don’t have to hide . I am well clear of what i am doing and i think i am doing just fine , given the fact that some tiny achievements i had made. It also reminds me that i can be MORE , i am far more capable than people’s thought , even though i don’t really know what kind of people i am in people’s eye. </p>

<p>Let it be clear , i do what i want and it’s totally free from the others’ concern from now on.It could be hard but i will fight for it.</p>

<p>In the end,Who the hell needs to learn physics , Japanese , and any other fucking stupid course while he’s put himself all into the field that he’s longing for ages ?</p>

<p>I am glad I’ve found my field, Programming in C of course !</p>

<p>:D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time I assumed that the first blog should be positive,funny or encouraging or something that&#8217;s filled with &#8220;keep on fighting&#8221;&#8230;.But this,right in the 2010&#8217;s first blog of Mr.sunus,He wants to spill it out! </p>

<p><strong>The courses picking system is fabulous,so i picked NONE</strong></p>

<p>As you may know this semester will come to an end shortly,along with beginning of the first courses picking that we have to deal with since i stepped into this campus.Realizing that the courses picking system is such a abso-fucking-lutely fabulous bullshit,i decided to write something. First of all,i came here for many reasons.But i am definitely sure of that none of any purpose is to earn CREDITS ! It&#8217;s the key point of this blog , if you disagree with me, you are free to leave.</p>

<p>Now,i can briefly introduce the so called courses picking system to you.The schedule is almost filled with physics,and ridiculous Japanese which were forced to pick.And What&#8217;s more?In the name of picking any courses flexibly and variously,they(school) provide us with a great deal of courses to select.But the truth is there is only a few course you can actually pick without bringing in any collisions.Because the schedule is almost full.In short,if you want to pick one or two courses,the schedule will be totally overloaded.So,the decision,picking no course,is easily to make. Because i do not want to be another college guy who is idle all the day,then showing up in a classroom just for some pity credits.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got my own business to do,i have my own big-plan to achieve.and most importantly,i believe in myself that i will ultimately get there,with or without the help of school.The future will not be planned but coded by my own fingers,brain,determination,and enthusiasm. So once again,Given the reasons as above,i picked none. Also,as noticing some people who hold different opinion on this courses picking thing,i just wanted to laugh.LOL! They rushed into the courses picking server,it just seems like “dead or pick”. I just wonder how could they got so many times to attend so many class while they acquire nothing but craps form their major,Oh i forget,they got credits as well.On the one side they want to be somebody,on the another side they just chose to learn how to become a crap.sigh&#8230;.</p>

<p>So,recently,one of the most catching phrase is &#8220;what do you pick?&#8221; OMFG</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alright,since the desk is shaking all the time which bothers me from sleeping,i decide to launch my last series blog of 2009 , also the first one of next coming year,2010.The title been made for one or two days or so.It is 2009,The good,the bad and the funny. And i will post several events with the order of good,bad,ugly.    </p>

<p><em><strong>The Good,The bad and the funny:D</strong></em></p>

<p>Round one:</p>

<p>Good: </p>

<p>i got in a university,even though it&#8217;s the one i longed for.But you know what? Only when i actually started off my college life can i truly realize it might makes no different to me if i got in a more renowned one or something like that.For me,Studying by myself is the most part of my life right now,For there&#8217;s not much left to learn in campus,for me. And i do proud of myself.and it&#8217;s the place where i can actually shine. I never feel the same way since elementary school,or junior school. So,it was absolutely a good one.  </p>

<p>Bad:</p>

<p>i am immature in quite many aspects.I was conscious of that just one or two weeks ago,kind of late?Unum..For i have done or said something reckless.Let the details remain un-public. But i do did it wrong. </p>

<p>Funny:</p>

<p>wow,there&#8217;s a lot to laugh about.I&#8217;d present it in various ways. In round one,here’s some pictures:</p>

<p><a href="https://npjmcw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1m9O8cPPehs5SlzMmwZpcNJIQhMRuJKAXEymPPcE4795laKIo7qgCtHIUrEmyLOWt6-JrJSlT35Vpq5S-CvFn_Mssx59gNexp_kbYL19NuRE3bFaKw3Zx6PrP-QVf4SQ740IZ-WIDAlWrbDwS0gyW1DQ/1%20(2"><img src="https://npjmcw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1mxWDN2RvCyDP2Gaf2EpJubx4US7aTmNWaQt6w0TzQiSCo6Ym5T71u8J9P4mEsEhZaICjYZjymFDjCwuldpCPYtXiv0xWRWMhYywGn_HZvAXxIbNAruAP3ghJgVEDhvOlTSyTTgONiSzwcSOwYbS5fwQ/1%20(2" alt="" />_thumb.jpg)</a>[2].jpg) <a href="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/002e2943107fb9a986fa9660385d9f70.jpg"><img src="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/002e2943107fb9a986fa9660385d9f70.jpg?w=251" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Round two:</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<p>i saved,or renewed some friendships that i lost in 2008.Without those wonderful guys my life would get tough,lonely,humdrum,helpless.</p>

<p>Life’s wonderful with you in this world.And now i wish all of you guys best of luck and having fun everyday!Last but not least,get healthier as hell :D</p>

<p> </p>

<p>stay tuned! and i gonna get drunk!</p>

<p><strong>Bad</strong>:i
am still thinner than average.No matter how hard i tried to eat , feast
was the only thing left.Which means i just could gain weight DAMN IT!</p>

<p><strong>Funny:</strong>Otaku..Obviously
it&#8217;s a Japanese term,but in some certain circumstances it can be very
funny.There&#8217;s one i got as below: A:i couldn&#8217;t go to her speech,because
i am kinda OTAKU. B:oh&#8230;I see. O ta ku( the same pronunciation as
Chinese,means oh,she/he cries.. )&#8230;.So brilliant,isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h3>Round3:</h3>

<p>Good:</p>

<p>Away
from home indeed has some benefits.Such as lead a life on my own way,i
purchase stuffs for myself,skip WISELY ,and have soup&#8230;.From all of
those you can find that,i am not the same guy since i touchdown in
Beijing.Not to mention i can buy medicine for myself which has never
ever happened to me.Quite incredible,even i gotta say so.But still,all
man needs a family to complete himself,to take considerable care of it</p>

<p>Bad:STAY TUNED!skipping happens in campus all the time.Some got caught,some got
away.Unfortunately,i got caught for several times.Especially there&#8217;s a time,once
i just skipped,less than 5minutes,the teacher began taking attendance.What the
F?</p>

<p>Final round:</p>

<p>Its 31st,Dec,the last day of 2009.Also means this so called 2009 summary
will come to an end.so all in all,There was not so many bad things happened to
me,which i thought it was.</p>

<p>On the other hand,so many great guys keep me company
and it does feel good! In fact,i could easily call up various funny,good thing
any second while i am writing it.I don&#8217;t even know which to post at all so,last
thing i would like to post is something about programming progresses i have
made.I coded a little,tiny stuff that can convert from day to date,or date to
day.E.g..The 85th days of 2010 is Fri,26th,March.</p>

<p>And i coded a HOME-MADE series
string functions.I am kinda proud of it.Besides,using Reverse Polish Notation to
make a lousy calculator also included.</p>

<p>I am still working on qsort,known as
quick-sort.This project lasts for about 20hours or so and last night i started
it over.In order to make lite,and efficient&#8230;.. All right,since there&#8217;s so many
left in 2009 but i can&#8217;t post. It&#8217;s time to say happy new year,best luck and
wish you guys succeed in whatever you do.</p>

<p>To my greatest mom,dad,grandpa and
family,i am always thinking of you .The unconditional love you put on me i would
never forget,i can never completely pay it back.But one thing is certain,i will try and let you see what this man is capable of!</p>

<p>Happy New year! BOOM ! BOOM BOOM!</p>

<p><END></p>

<p>  4.Several years of large systems software design and development experience, with extensive knowledge of Unix/Linux.</p>

<p>5.Coding skills in Python or Javascript/AJAX, database design and
SQL, and/or knowledge of TCP/IP and network programming are a plus.</p>

<p>  6.Fluency in English (reading and writing).</p>

<p>Hopefully&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s getting boring now,i kind of wonder why it seems like everyone in this room are really into the class while i just don&#8217;t know what to do and write this blog on my cellphone&#8230;In fact,i was planning to read a novel called &#8221;crazy programmer&#8217;,but,now sitting right next to two girls who always giggle all the time since i asked is this seat available,i don&#8217;t wanna act as a bad guy or something like that so i keep my fingers moving which indicates i am doing something else other than reading meaningless online novels.By the way,The crazy programmer is really worth-reading and a must for me,i think. </p>

<p>Since the class is absolutely  humdrum as usual though,posting something interesting would be good.Seemingly i didn&#8217;t remember anything fun or interesting except coding,which takes most of my time,even class.When it comes to class,i am just unfortunate or destined to be that.Skipping happens all the class but every time i do so,the god damn teachers take attendance.What the heck? Fine,i will figure out a way to getaway.Sigh.,</p>

<p>The class carries on,so does my writing process.Heading to Beijing tomorrow kind of exciting,particularly when thinking about the meat,all night movies on and some unpredictable stand-ups.You&#8217;d better cut that minds off your head!</p>

<p>And what&#8217;s more,it&#8217;s a bit of cold out there,i updated my QQ status as below&#8221;Show me your hands,I&#8217;ll warm it up&#8221;,There&#8217;s a certain name hidden in it&#8230;And it&#8217;s pretty catchy<sup>^</sup> Hoping the one can at least say something to me,please. </p>

<p>Suddenly,One more thing pop up on my schedule，that is,CET4 EXAM,which i thought it&#8217;s a piece of cake for me. But,no give no gain.At least i should do something to prepare it.And class finally came to an end.</p>

<p>That’s a a mess-four-paragraph blog,hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>peace:D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In fact,i should have given this presentation without paper,which is strongly recommended by teacher.and i will explain why right after.<br/>
My topic is several pieces of thoughts that occurred to me since i came here,please notice that what you are going to to hear are just thoughts,not advice.ok?<br/>
The first one is,Being sick really sucks,especially when you&#8217;re alone.Take me as an example,I gotta go to the clinic to have injections for severval times and in case of any bad illness happen to me,i still had to got to hospital that is located in downtown,where has the facilities to give me a full-scan,and fortunately,it&#8217;s just normal diseases,But still,hurt me a lot!Besides,During those days i was sick,It had became extremely hard for me to take good care of myself.Eventually,everything is going toward the best and I can have class as usual.But you know what this disaster leave to me? Endless catching-up stuffs and Countless times that wasted with it,what is worse, I just watched it ,then let it happened and there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it except sleeping and taking medicine. So that&#8217;s why i am giving this presentation with a paper,i did not have to recite it,with the workload i have right now,which is already heavier than usual.So,do be carefully with your body that will keep you company for the lifetime.they are precious and priceless.<br/>
Sorry for the healthy part that&#8217;s too long to listen,i will make rest of them as short as possible.<br/>
Second one,i realized that if someone just don&#8217;t have what it takes to do what he&#8217;s doing right now,then quit and never try it any longer.Because this word”try” refers to unsuccessful in dictionary.That means,no matter how hard you try,you will never get there.So,just go find anything else that fits you perfectly and devote all of yourself into it before you still can and still young. <br/>
Third,A lot of disposable time out there that is needed to be managed properly instead of doing what you want at that moment or even worse,sleeping or simply having fun,so please stop doing those stupid things.Time&#8217;s tight and precious,we should cherish it.<br/>
Last but no least ,Out of stressful high school life just a sign of another whole new life that&#8217;s filled with more invisible pressure to come.All of us should be clearly aware of that before it&#8217;s too late.A fresh new start is university&#8217;s all about.Life’s short,go for it.<br/>
That all,thanks for listening.May you guys free from illness and sickness&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All right here i am again,every single minutes of the English class is extremely as boring as hell. And thanks to that meaningless presentation i gotta to prepare ahead of time.You may ask questions like that&#8221;why the hell are you doing that,the sunus i knew never do those stuffs..&#8221;because i am like a kind of model here,and model should do things good&#8221; so,here comes my speech&#8230;      </p>

<p>Third,Out of stressful high school life just a sign of another whole new life that&#8217;s filled with more invisible pressure to come.All of us should be clearly aware of that before it&#8217;s too late.A fresh new start is university&#8217;s all about.Life’s short,go for it.</p>

<p>That all,thanks for listening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been two months since i first met you in the plane.Time flies,right? Everything happened between us is just like a flash,yesterday we’re close and today saw that you’re gone.As a matter of fact,i wanted to invited you to dinner tonight and i planed it before we lost in touch.Don’t ask why,i don’t know,maybe i just wanted to spill out those things since there’s no one else can chat with,not to mention the “LiuPu”.I don’t know what’s on you mind,but that thing is as simple as it’s.</p>

<p>Yesterday,we’ve got a great deal of topics to chat about,and i remember the last topic is about movie,and i did watch <em>The graduate,</em>so that i could talk it if i could meet you some day.Without you,my life wasn’t changed that much,i had to take good care of myself as usual and i started to buy fruits thanks to the illness.Sometimes,Thinking about whether you’re busy or something took over my head but finally i can get rid of them in two or three minutes.You’re a person of ambitions,you’ve got a clear goal and know where headed for.That’s great,otherwise how i was possible to want you to be my friends ? And i wanna be yours,too. That day is approaching,but you will definitely do excellent job and get in wherever you want.You can pull it off and you will.Here i just give you my best wishes.</p>

<p>Today,01,11,what a magical day!It’s not only the two-months-away from home memorial but also took my illness away and brought me a whole new start.But sadly,i had dinner with someone else from my dormitory instead you:&lt; Anyway,Let it be,if fate wanna take you away from my life,then fine.Encountering in the plane wasn’t a coincidence whatsoever,so waiting for the turn between us.</p>

<p>You know what? yesterday i watched a movies and i saw a girl’s ways of looking at people and smile are just like you ,which fascinate me a lot,so i think about you again but without any further thoughts.Let’s take a look at those pictures:&lt;lol,for further information,contact me.></p>

<p>That’s one of the elements i felt that makes you distinguish,So that i can recognize you among the crowd by this very smile.So,keep smiling,for yourself.  </p>

<p>see you, and have a nice day!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another boring day begins,i rushed to classroom and found myself a seat in the corner.Trying and struggling to focus on the class,unfortunately i failed doing so which brought me another break right in the class.At 10am when my first class about to came to an end i was woken by hunger. So,i just waited hungrily. Finally,i got myself some foods and go on taking my next class,English which i thought it should be programming instead.Hence,i didn&#8217;t take the books and i have time to write those sort of of meaningless stuffs. It all started with the boring classes begin,now teacher is asking questions a so while i am writing this,i also have got to prepare for the answer.It super sucks,besides i sitting right next the guy i don&#8217;t like very much.Just think about how long we&#8217;ve met each other and i already began to resent you.How pathetic ! And i hope you just do not bother me now and forever !</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s put those stupid things behind our back and talk something interesting.  As you know,i am famous for leading a OTAKU life,no societies,no group and party. For that reason,the first impression i gave to those people around is a internet-addicted guy who is poor at everything with weak strength.Don&#8217;t even think about i got some good skills in sports. So,consequently i proved them wrong and show them what the next generation of otaku guy is by action,which surely surprise them a lot.The most brilliant guy should be a most laid-back one. Kind of unbelievable,right?</p>

<p>LOL.. Latest update: the last class about to begin and i just wait as i usual do.There&#8217;s on thing always on my mind,which is about my flymate.I will post another blog to write it out.</p>
