	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I usually do not feeling once i got interrupt by noise or something like that during the sleep. That really sucks and therefore i don&#8217;t talk to them for two or three hours ! This time , There&#8217;s not any communications as usual , but i am kind of happy for some certain reasons.<br/>
First of all , i finalized the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm as well as the failure function within it and i do feel happy about it. and i also felt that the KMP was a sign or hint for me , like quicksort or Hanoi or anything else that&#8217;s just AMAZING and EFFICIENT stuffs to tell me &#8220;hey dude ! since you have already got me , why don&#8217;t you go father to find more , to acquire more ?&#8221; yep, that&#8217;s what i do . and the more i explore , the more i need to know&#8230; but still , In the chasing of something you love , you gotta get well prepared of that.<br/>
OK,let&#8217;s move on. i always consider myself as a luck one.just like i finalized the kmp , i got at least two rewards . and yeah, both of them are wonderful and i just post it in time sequence.</p>

<p>The first one is i got a message that asked me whether i had dinner or not and at the beginning i don&#8217;t really notice that. but after two or three minutes , i figured , even a rock might also realized that she&#8217;s asking me out ! and soon as we met , i also realized that she might want to something outside the school , so alright then we got to a Korean barbecue . food&#8217;s great and i admit that i have not taste it yet. so , it&#8217;s great but it didn&#8217;t fill me up ? :D<br/>
during the dinner , we talked over a couple of topics including school life , movies , plans for the future , human natures ( kind of weird , but i still think i am the good one ) and so on. so , it has been great fun when having dinner with she. and when nothing&#8217;s left on the table that&#8217;s still available to eat,we checked out and headed back to campus.</p>

<p>Good things never came alone . when i got back to my dormitory i started to browsing people&#8217;s IM status,due to i just finished the kmp , and i found a target who is suffering from the ice cream that caused her feel pain.so , remember it seems like we didn&#8217;t talk much except some smile face since she decided not to visit me due to the AIESEC team discipline or something i don&#8217;t know. so , i sent &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with you and are you feeling super hot so that you must get some ice cream during the cold season.?&#8221; so it turned out to be a good starter , and conversation began, later on i showed off a little bit that i got a girl with me to dinner and how yummy the food was. all of a sudden , I got a message “i am going to sneak out to meet you !” then , i don&#8217;t get the time to think of what just happened , not to mention how to respond it properly. because another message came instantly &#8220;i got a C problem&#8221; blah blah blah&#8230; or,maybe i should have reply something like alright then . or you’re very welcome! :D</p>

<p>the class goes on and my phone is dying. so i just make it last as long as it can.</p>

<p>Turning to twenty means a lot of to me . there&#8217;s something big coming down in the near future that is the first important decision that i have ever made for my own path. Now i just need to prove that&#8217;s the right thing to do !</p>

<p>Bye!</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2010/03/18/hithered/">Hi,there:D</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>this time was kind of usual , for i got to the classroom before the class begins. 0h no, Now the class began. several seconds ago, the fat,short teacher just hung out on the web to show he&#8217;s using wiki via the whole English pages. Is this wroth showing off? I can even get the latest playboy magazine..and Stanford university&#8217;s whole computer sciences classes.</p>

<p>yeah,a another week almost go away and i did acquire something new,that is,some data structs like RING,link list,double link list as well. besides,Gaining a deep understanding to the stack and heap that is tightly related to the recursion that&#8217;s huge and once you understand all of these,you can easily solve the Hanoi tower,and save the world:D but still,i still have a lot of work to do,so i left this here,to motivate me : keep strong till you get there , AND become stronger after you get there. FYI : this comes form a terrorist , funny though? <br/>
maybe,teacher &#8216;s about to get me answer a question, : umh.. i don&#8217;t really got a superstar in sports field,because i do not really care sport scene except table tennis,but as far as i know,table tennis is just belongs to those players who practice most,who scarifies most.so i really don&#8217;t see any superstar out there..ok that&#8217;s over.Teacher just moved on and i didn&#8217;t get a chance to answer it.</p>

<p>Yesterday , finally i get back (i think) a friend that i always wanted.I mean,as a cherish friend of mine , so please don&#8217;t get me wrong this time after reading those sweet words:D <br/>
then,we got to chat about the study,future,and something i think she may want do try, THE UI stuffs,lucky i know something about it ,therefore i offered some constructive suggestions (i think as well).It makes me feel great to help people,especially when the one that i cherish. <br/>
the first half is finalized.i would like to get my head up instead of fixing on the mobile device.<br/>
looking around,nothing special nothing attract me except a little gal,but,yeah i have seen plenty of them, so that&#8217;s it.</p>

		<p>as long as i am in school,i will never be worried about my blog do not get enough updates since the English classes as boring as it should be. therefore,once again i start to post this blog with my NEW device,that is,Nokia N900 with maemo 5 operation system.please give the warmest welcome to this little but high-intelligence buddy.Now i can be far more efficient with the typing than before.</p>

<p>i should NOT have been here ! but at the last minute when the decision was about to made , i chickened out. so the flight was booked and i am here for another new semester.anyway,i got a kind of relief and it comes from my family , how strange it&#8217;s !<br/>
with many goals and plans , i keep on compromising with my own career and school stuffs. but , yeah i do not give a damn shit about the later and it&#8217;s just like a fat,ugly,old woman for me.</p>

<p>Mr.sunus moves on with both feet and eventually he will get there,get the hottest,sweet,considerate and thoughtful gal on the planet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hum,yeah,The first semester  is going to be over , and yeah , just like i said right after the Nation College Entrance Exams , “Life goes on , yeah , it does! ”</p>

<p>Back to last night,i lost sleep due to a problem i always think about recently “What’s all about going to a university ? Considering the fact that  my parents provide me with finance supplement and any other stuffs for ages.I still can’t take it for grant. ” i can’t do that ! “</p>

<p>So , last night , or last week , more specifically i feel like i like a idle people or something that i always despise . Because the least thing i like to do forced me to get into it all the week and i can’t even get rid of it.Why? It’s like a measure or aspect to evaluate whether i was doing good during the semester or not for them .  I got absolutely strongest feeling that i did this for none other then THEM. Who the heck are they ? I am not sure if it’s my mom,grandpa or someone else but it’s definitely neither Me nor my dad. However,I am the one who’s in university and also the one that makes the call to choice what kind of man i want to be, to decide what should i learn and what i don’t need to do at all . Now that , I have the answers to that , i don’t have to hide . I am well clear of what i am doing and i think i am doing just fine , given the fact that some tiny achievements i had made. It also reminds me that i can be MORE , i am far more capable than people’s thought , even though i don’t really know what kind of people i am in people’s eye. </p>

<p>Let it be clear , i do what i want and it’s totally free from the others’ concern from now on.It could be hard but i will fight for it.</p>

<p>In the end,Who the hell needs to learn physics , Japanese , and any other fucking stupid course while he’s put himself all into the field that he’s longing for ages ?</p>

<p>I am glad I’ve found my field, Programming in C of course !</p>

<p>:D</p>

		<p>Once upon a time I assumed that the first blog should be positive,funny or encouraging or something that&#8217;s filled with &#8220;keep on fighting&#8221;&#8230;.But this,right in the 2010&#8217;s first blog of Mr.sunus,He wants to spill it out! </p>

<p><strong>The courses picking system is fabulous,so i picked NONE</strong></p>

<p>As you may know this semester will come to an end shortly,along with beginning of the first courses picking that we have to deal with since i stepped into this campus.Realizing that the courses picking system is such a abso-fucking-lutely fabulous bullshit,i decided to write something. First of all,i came here for many reasons.But i am definitely sure of that none of any purpose is to earn CREDITS ! It&#8217;s the key point of this blog , if you disagree with me, you are free to leave.</p>

<p>Now,i can briefly introduce the so called courses picking system to you.The schedule is almost filled with physics,and ridiculous Japanese which were forced to pick.And What&#8217;s more?In the name of picking any courses flexibly and variously,they(school) provide us with a great deal of courses to select.But the truth is there is only a few course you can actually pick without bringing in any collisions.Because the schedule is almost full.In short,if you want to pick one or two courses,the schedule will be totally overloaded.So,the decision,picking no course,is easily to make. Because i do not want to be another college guy who is idle all the day,then showing up in a classroom just for some pity credits.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got my own business to do,i have my own big-plan to achieve.and most importantly,i believe in myself that i will ultimately get there,with or without the help of school.The future will not be planned but coded by my own fingers,brain,determination,and enthusiasm. So once again,Given the reasons as above,i picked none. Also,as noticing some people who hold different opinion on this courses picking thing,i just wanted to laugh.LOL! They rushed into the courses picking server,it just seems like “dead or pick”. I just wonder how could they got so many times to attend so many class while they acquire nothing but craps form their major,Oh i forget,they got credits as well.On the one side they want to be somebody,on the another side they just chose to learn how to become a crap.sigh&#8230;.</p>

<p>So,recently,one of the most catching phrase is &#8220;what do you pick?&#8221; OMFG</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2009/12/25/mr-sunus-in-2009/">Mr..sunus in 2009</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Alright,since the desk is shaking all the time which bothers me from sleeping,i decide to launch my last series blog of 2009 , also the first one of next coming year,2010.The title been made for one or two days or so.It is 2009,The good,the bad and the funny. And i will post several events with the order of good,bad,ugly.    </p>

<p><em><strong>The Good,The bad and the funny:D</strong></em></p>

<p>Round one:</p>

<p>Good: </p>

<p>i got in a university,even though it&#8217;s the one i longed for.But you know what? Only when i actually started off my college life can i truly realize it might makes no different to me if i got in a more renowned one or something like that.For me,Studying by myself is the most part of my life right now,For there&#8217;s not much left to learn in campus,for me. And i do proud of myself.and it&#8217;s the place where i can actually shine. I never feel the same way since elementary school,or junior school. So,it was absolutely a good one.  </p>

<p>Bad:</p>

<p>i am immature in quite many aspects.I was conscious of that just one or two weeks ago,kind of late?Unum..For i have done or said something reckless.Let the details remain un-public. But i do did it wrong. </p>

<p>Funny:</p>

<p>wow,there&#8217;s a lot to laugh about.I&#8217;d present it in various ways. In round one,here’s some pictures:</p>

<p><a href="https://npjmcw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1m9O8cPPehs5SlzMmwZpcNJIQhMRuJKAXEymPPcE4795laKIo7qgCtHIUrEmyLOWt6-JrJSlT35Vpq5S-CvFn_Mssx59gNexp_kbYL19NuRE3bFaKw3Zx6PrP-QVf4SQ740IZ-WIDAlWrbDwS0gyW1DQ/1%20(2"><img src="https://npjmcw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1mxWDN2RvCyDP2Gaf2EpJubx4US7aTmNWaQt6w0TzQiSCo6Ym5T71u8J9P4mEsEhZaICjYZjymFDjCwuldpCPYtXiv0xWRWMhYywGn_HZvAXxIbNAruAP3ghJgVEDhvOlTSyTTgONiSzwcSOwYbS5fwQ/1%20(2" alt="" />_thumb.jpg)</a>[2].jpg) <a href="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/002e2943107fb9a986fa9660385d9f70.jpg"><img src="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/002e2943107fb9a986fa9660385d9f70.jpg?w=251" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Round two:</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<p>i saved,or renewed some friendships that i lost in 2008.Without those wonderful guys my life would get tough,lonely,humdrum,helpless.</p>

<p>Life’s wonderful with you in this world.And now i wish all of you guys best of luck and having fun everyday!Last but not least,get healthier as hell :D</p>

<p> </p>

<p>stay tuned! and i gonna get drunk!</p>

<p><strong>Bad</strong>:i
am still thinner than average.No matter how hard i tried to eat , feast
was the only thing left.Which means i just could gain weight DAMN IT!</p>

<p><strong>Funny:</strong>Otaku..Obviously
it&#8217;s a Japanese term,but in some certain circumstances it can be very
funny.There&#8217;s one i got as below: A:i couldn&#8217;t go to her speech,because
i am kinda OTAKU. B:oh&#8230;I see. O ta ku( the same pronunciation as
Chinese,means oh,she/he cries.. )&#8230;.So brilliant,isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h3>Round3:</h3>

<p>Good:</p>

<p>Away
from home indeed has some benefits.Such as lead a life on my own way,i
purchase stuffs for myself,skip WISELY ,and have soup&#8230;.From all of
those you can find that,i am not the same guy since i touchdown in
Beijing.Not to mention i can buy medicine for myself which has never
ever happened to me.Quite incredible,even i gotta say so.But still,all
man needs a family to complete himself,to take considerable care of it</p>

<p>Bad:STAY TUNED!skipping happens in campus all the time.Some got caught,some got
away.Unfortunately,i got caught for several times.Especially there&#8217;s a time,once
i just skipped,less than 5minutes,the teacher began taking attendance.What the
F?</p>

<p>Final round:</p>

<p>Its 31st,Dec,the last day of 2009.Also means this so called 2009 summary
will come to an end.so all in all,There was not so many bad things happened to
me,which i thought it was.</p>

<p>On the other hand,so many great guys keep me company
and it does feel good! In fact,i could easily call up various funny,good thing
any second while i am writing it.I don&#8217;t even know which to post at all so,last
thing i would like to post is something about programming progresses i have
made.I coded a little,tiny stuff that can convert from day to date,or date to
day.E.g..The 85th days of 2010 is Fri,26th,March.</p>

<p>And i coded a HOME-MADE series
string functions.I am kinda proud of it.Besides,using Reverse Polish Notation to
make a lousy calculator also included.</p>

<p>I am still working on qsort,known as
quick-sort.This project lasts for about 20hours or so and last night i started
it over.In order to make lite,and efficient&#8230;.. All right,since there&#8217;s so many
left in 2009 but i can&#8217;t post. It&#8217;s time to say happy new year,best luck and
wish you guys succeed in whatever you do.</p>

<p>To my greatest mom,dad,grandpa and
family,i am always thinking of you .The unconditional love you put on me i would
never forget,i can never completely pay it back.But one thing is certain,i will try and let you see what this man is capable of!</p>

<p>Happy New year! BOOM ! BOOM BOOM!</p>

<p><END></p>

		<p>Department Overview (&#8220;The area&#8221;):</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s software engineers develop the next-generation
technologies for which we&#8217;ve become world-renowned. In addition to
revolutionizing search technology, we use our world-class programming
skills to innovate in a number of other areas as well. Our projects
include working on advanced information-retrieval algorithms, massive
scalability and storage solutions, and large-scale applications that
enrich the user experience. We also work extensively on networking
systems, advertising systems and complex transaction systems in
consumer applications.</p>

<p>Job Description (&#8220;The role&#8221;):</p>

<p>  Software Engineers have a passion for solving complex and interesting problems.</p>

<p>Google is much more than search, and our mission has much greater
scope. To handle information at the scale of the web requires ideas
from just about every area of computer science, including information

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s getting boring now,i kind of wonder why it seems like everyone in this room are really into the class while i just don&#8217;t know what to do and write this blog on my cellphone&#8230;In fact,i was planning to read a novel called &#8221;crazy programmer&#8217;,but,now sitting right next to two girls who always giggle all the time since i asked is this seat available,i don&#8217;t wanna act as a bad guy or something like that so i keep my fingers moving which indicates i am doing something else other than reading meaningless online novels.By the way,The crazy programmer is really worth-reading and a must for me,i think. </p>

<p>Since the class is absolutely  humdrum as usual though,posting something interesting would be good.Seemingly i didn&#8217;t remember anything fun or interesting except coding,which takes most of my time,even class.When it comes to class,i am just unfortunate or destined to be that.Skipping happens all the class but every time i do so,the god damn teachers take attendance.What the heck? Fine,i will figure out a way to getaway.Sigh.,</p>

<p>The class carries on,so does my writing process.Heading to Beijing tomorrow kind of exciting,particularly when thinking about the meat,all night movies on and some unpredictable stand-ups.You&#8217;d better cut that minds off your head!</p>

<p>And what&#8217;s more,it&#8217;s a bit of cold out there,i updated my QQ status as below&#8221;Show me your hands,I&#8217;ll warm it up&#8221;,There&#8217;s a certain name hidden in it&#8230;And it&#8217;s pretty catchy<sup>^</sup> Hoping the one can at least say something to me,please. </p>

<p>Suddenly,One more thing pop up on my schedule，that is,CET4 EXAM,which i thought it&#8217;s a piece of cake for me. But,no give no gain.At least i should do something to prepare it.And class finally came to an end.</p>

<p>That’s a a mess-four-paragraph blog,hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>peace:D</p>

		<p>The C provides considerable freedom for programmers.The pointer of C can not check the limits of array and string,but this factor IS ABSOLUTELY NOT responsible for any poor programs.It&#8217;s Poor programmers that make this happen all the time!!</p>

<p>ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT AND KEEP ON CODING!</p>
