<p>From 60 minutes </p>

<p> </p>

<p>============================================================</p>

<p><strong>CBS) </strong>Worldwide sales of video game consoles and software are expected to reach $35 billion this year – that’s more than twice the revenue of the NFL, the NBA, and Major League Baseball combined. With hundreds of millions of people playing worldwide, it was perhaps inevitable that sporting competition would develop and give rise to the professional video game player.</p>

<p>The very best bill themselves as cyber-athletes, and crisscross the globe competing in tournaments that offer hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money. The number one player is someone called &#8220;Fatal1ty.&#8221; That’s his screen name, anyway. As <strong><em>60 Minutes</em> correspondent Steve Kroft</strong> reports, his real name is Johnathan Wendel. Every new sport needs stars, and Fatal1ty is the first superstar of video games. If he didn’t already exist, someone would have to invent him.</p>

<hr />

<p>The best video game player in America lives in Kansas City, Missouri. When <strong><em>60 Minutes</em></strong> showed up for the interview, Johnathan Wendel was in the family rec room, riveted to his computer screen. He was using a mouse and a keyboard to propel himself through a computer-generated landscape in search of ominous red demons to kill before they kill him. It’s how he makes his living, and why he calls himself Fatal1ty. He was locked in a virtual death match with his opponents, oblivious to everything around him, including our arrival.</p>

<p>Wendel had been practicing a game called “Painkiller” day and night with his friends and sparring partners, one of whom was crashed out on the bed. They were trying to get ready for the next big tournament in Dallas.</p>

<p>Wendel has been a pro for six years. When we first interviewed him last summer, he said he had won over $300,000 in tournament prize money.</p>

<p>There are parents all over the country that are telling their kids, &#8220;Shut off the video game. You&#8217;re wasting your time.&#8221; Wendel says he got that, too.</p>

<p>At age 24, he has won 41 tournaments, playing the same shoot’em-up video games that you can buy in most stores and living a life most young men his age can only dream of. He has traveled, all-expenses paid, to every continent except Antarctica. He has played in Moscow&#8217;s Red Square, and on the Great Wall of China. And everywhere he goes, he is besieged by fans.</p>

<p>When we first caught up with him, he had won world championships in four different video games, and was training to add a championship win in a fifth game.</p>

<p>He says nobody else has done that, &#8220;not even close.&#8221;</p>

<p>Asked if he is the best in the world, he replies, &#8220;If you say so. I&#8217;m trying to be modest here but, yes. I&#8217;m pretty good.”</p>

<p>If he hadn’t discovered professional gaming he would probably be doing tech support for some computer company in Kansas City. He was only 18 at the time and still living at home.</p>

<p>What was his mother’s reaction when he told her that he wanted to become a professional video game player?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh that probably didn’t go so well,&#8221; Wendel says with a chuckle.</p>

<p>His parents were divorced, so having failed to persuade his mother, he moved in with his dad and went to work on him, offering him a deal: &#8220;I was like, &#8216;Dad, just let me go to this one tournament. If I don’t win any money, like any significant money, I’m going to quit. I’ll just quit, I’ll go full time school, no problem,&#8217;&#8221; Wendel remembers.</p>

<p>He went to the tournament and won $4,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;And came home and slapped that check on the table. And I go, &#8216;Dad, I won $4,000 playing a video game. What’s this world coming to?&#8217; &#8221; says Wendel, adding, &#8220;it was so insane.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the 2004 World Cyber Games championships in San Francisco, the purse totaled more than $400,000.</p>

<p>The tournaments are often broadcast live over the Internet, complete with play-by-play commentary.</p>

<p>There are both individual and team competitions, and coaches with furrowed brows pacing the sidelines.</p>

<p>It has the look and feel of a sporting event and to Johnathan Wendel, that’s exactly what it is.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about hand-eye coordination, reflexes, timing, strategy, being quick on your feet, being able to think fast,&#8221; Wendel says. &#8220;You got to be doing everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>He may spend eight to 12 hours a day in front of a video screen, but don’t mistake him for a geek.</p>

<p>Like most of the top video game professionals, he is an excellent athlete, and was a star on his high school tennis team.</p>

<p>&#8220;I work out a lot &#8211; you know being physically fit and making sure your neurotransmitters are working properly and making sure that you&#8217;re on beat and you&#8217;re ready to go,&#8221; says Wendel.</p>

<p>He calls that &#8220;neuro-fitness&#8221; and he believes it makes him think faster.</p>

<p>He also talks really fast. Are those his neurotransmitters?</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s actually my brain talk thinking way too fast,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p><strong>CBS) </strong> <br/>
He says competitive video gaming is like playing chess on caffeine. An exhibition he played against a local challenger in Sweden is a good example.</p>

<p>You have to strategically maneuver yourself though a three-dimensional maze, using the controls to collect weapons and ammunition while executing precision moves to evade, trap and corner your opponent before splattering him all over the dungeon – a detail some people find disconcerting.</p>

<p>Wendel spends hours each day trying to kill people in the virtual gaming world. Does he think that is a good thing?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing,” he says. “I mean you&#8217;re trying to get the point. Like, I mean, football. Why are you hitting the guy? That&#8217;s not right. But people will pass it, because that&#8217;s part of the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider him an athlete because marksmanship is an Olympic sport, right? That&#8217;s twitching the fingers as well,&#8221; says Edward Castronova, a professor at Indiana University who studies and teaches the economics and sociology of video games.</p>

<p>&#8220;The average age of a video gamer is now 30. And you&#8217;re getting to a point where the number of people who could pay money and spend time to watch is getting big enough to support a spectator sport,&#8221; says Castronova.</p>

<p>Parents all over the country watch their children play video games and he doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that exciting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, baseball&#8217;s not exciting to somebody from France, either. It&#8217;s the kind of thing you have to know what&#8217;s going on inside the game to really appreciate why getting onto that ledge and getting that power up at the moment was just an awesome move that nobody&#8217;s ever able to do. It&#8217;s a skill that 30 years from now a lot of people will understand,&#8221; says Castronova.</p>

<p>They already get it in South Korea. A video game tournament in the country’s second largest city drew a crowd of 100,000 people last year, and regular matches draw big ratings on national television. The top Korean players make hundreds of thousands of dollars, date movie stars, and need bodyguards to protect them from their overenthusiastic fans.</p>

<p>And a lot of people are betting that it’s only a matter of time before the same thing happens in the U.S., and that pro video gaming will eventually take off, like skateboarding and extreme sports did a decade ago. Because of the Internet, players from all over the world can meet and compete, and it’s all happening in real time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our reigning stereotype of video gamer is a 16-year-old kid who is alone in his basement. And that&#8217;s not really true any more,&#8221; says Castronova.</p>

<p>Does Castronova see it as social intercourse?</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, I see it as a very, very broad communication phenomenon. The parallel would be phones, radios, movies, TV,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p><strong>_60 Minutes</strong> caught a glimpse of it last year when we followed Fatal1ty to the frozen hinterlands of Sweden to witness a digital version of Woodstock called a &#8220;LAN Party.&#8221; Nearly 6,000 young people lugged their desktops through the snow to a convention center, where they hooked them up together and played video games for three days and three nights, with only occasional breaks for sleep.</p>

<p>What does Wendel think is the attraction?</p>

<p>&#8220;The reason why these events happen is because you want to meet the person in real life. You play on the Internet all the time and you see their name. But you don&#8217;t know what they look like,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re really like in person.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>(CBS) </strong> <br/>
It has become a huge subculture, comprised mostly of young men that spend more money on video games than they do on music or going to the movies.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a community of interest big enough to attract prize money, advertising revenue - and merchandising deals from companies peddling computers, video games, and soft drinks. All are desperate to sell gamers something - if they ever get up from their video games. And no one is better positioned to make a killing than Johnathan Wendel.</p>

<p>He has just launched his own brand of Fatal1ty products, including mouse pads, keyboards, and headsets, built specifically for video gaming – all done with the help of his marketing guru, Mark Walden.</p>

<p>Walden says Wendel is going to make millions of dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the new millennium comes a new sportsman, the e-sportsman. So, he is the first cyber athlete, so to speak,&#8221; says Walden. &#8220;You know, you look back 50 years from now and there had to be someone at the turn of the century that played baseball. There had to be a Babe Ruth and a Ty Cobb. There has to be a Johnathan &#8220;Fatal1ty&#8221; Wendel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walden thinks Wendel will be viewed as the Babe Ruth of the 21st century. &#8220;I think Johnathan will go down as the guy who, basically, brought gaming, as a sport, mainstream,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Amidst all this hype, agents and promoters are already scouting the next generation of stars. No fledgling sport is complete without a prodigy, and in professional video gaming, that mantle has fallen to seven-year-old Victor De Leon III, a.k.a “Lil Poison.”</p>

<p>Kroft played a round with &#8220;Lil Poison.&#8221; How did he rate as an opponent?</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad,&#8221; De Leon says.</p>

<p>&#8220;How bad?” Kroft asks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Super bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lil Poison&#8221; is still too young to have a paper route, yet he has already won $2,000 playing in tournaments against adults, and he has signed an exclusive deal with Sundance DiGiovanni and Mike Sepso, who run Major League Gaming, which organizes tournaments and helps clients land endorsement deals.</p>

<p>But De Leon is only seven years old. “What is he going to endorse?” Kroft asks. “Happy Meals?”</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, there are crazier endorsers out there,” DiGiovanni says. “You know, he represents something which a lot of people right now are trying to figure out how to grab hold of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last November in New York, Fatal1ty was trying to grab hold of another world championship, in a fifth game, &#8220;Painkiller.&#8221; But this time, he entered the finals as the underdog against his chief nemesis and reigning champion in the game, a 20-year-old Dutchman known as &#8220;Vo0.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the culmination of a ten-city, $1 million world tour organized by the Cyberathlete Professional League. After falling behind early in the tournament, Fatal1ty mounted a valiant comeback.</p>

<p>With his back against the wall, he came up clutch. And all of that experience paid off.</p>

<p>The first prize was $150,000, the biggest check of Wendel&#8217;s career, and a sum that should go a long way towards finally impressing his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what? I’m pretty sure they’re impressed. But you know, the day I drive up in a Ferrari in front of the house, that’s going to be the day that I’m going to say, &#8216;I did it,&#8217;&#8221; says Wendel.</p>

<p>Will it be a case of &#8220;I told you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That’s the day. That’ll be a nice day.&#8221;</p>

		<p>我要JXY。。好黑刺激的事</p>

<p>　　夫生死海深，轮回路险，最易犯者杀生，最难断者淫欲。且欲为生死根本，若不断除，菩提难期。今有在家学佛众弟子，共同发愿，从戒邪淫入手，渐渐增进，“必使淫机，身心俱断，断性亦无”。然自力微弱，佛力堪凭，单修多退，互助有功。故为早成佛道，广度众生，三宝弟子momeNt，谨在自己最尊敬的某佛某菩萨前，翘勤雨泪，五体投地，求哀忏悔（礼佛菩萨三拜），愿诸佛菩萨慈悲加持，令弟子及法界有情往昔所造一切罪障即时蠲除，弟子momeNt并与佛友们共同庄严发誓，从今日起：</p>

<p>在网络上：　</p>

<p>　　我发誓决不主动看色情及挑逗性的网站、网页、文字（含成人笑话）、图片、视频、动画（含FLASH&#8211;网络动画）；不上有关论坛 ；不去有关聊天室；不参与有关活动及游戏，决不听网上色情声音。<br/>
　　我发誓绝对不主动单击以影视娱乐、时装模特、人体艺术、性教育、妇科知识、性用品为幌子的不良网站和链接。<br/>
　　我发誓决不主动搜索邪淫方面的网址，不在自己主持的网站或论坛上链接邪淫方面的网站、网页。<br/>
　　我尽量劝一位以上网络好友来参与此次“共同誓愿戒邪淫”活动（不必马上成功）。</p>

<p>在网络下：</p>

<p>　　我发誓不和配偶以外的任何异性或同性发生性关系。<br/>
　　我发誓决不主动到色情场所（含涉嫌场所）；决不手淫；即使是自己伴侣，也决不贪恋房事。<br/>
　　我发誓不看色情（包括三级、低级趣味的）电影、影碟、画报、小说，不玩此类游戏。<br/>
　　条件成熟我一定将此发愿单至少打印送一个亲朋好友。</p>

<p>无论网络上下：</p>

<p>　　我发誓绝对不写、不制作色情或挑逗性的文字、音像、网页、图片、视频、动画（含FLASH&#8211;网络动画），不传播转贴有关内容。<br/>
　　我发誓决不说下流话，决不骂人。<br/>
　　我发誓遇到亲朋好友有类似邪淫问题，一定想法委婉劝阻（能否成功不计，被人讥笑不计）；若见亲朋好友保存类似音像书刊，委婉劝其销毁。<br/>
　　我发誓不对异性或同性佛友、好友乃至一切男女起非分之想，并诚恳忏悔此类过去业障；如有此类妄念习气现前，立即令其消灭，决不再结来世情缘。<br/>
　　我发誓决不用手机发送黄色短信息，决不用手机转储黄色图片。如果收到朋友的有关信息或见到朋友发生类似情况，相机劝说，言以利害，劝其戒断。 <br/>
　　所有被劝亲友，如暂时无缘接受，愿发慈悲心、怜悯心，不生瞋恨心、舍弃心。</p>

<p>　　我每月至少将此誓言重温一遍。</p>

<p>　　以上誓言，为自他一切众生出尘劳了生死而立。如被外境所迷、习气所使欲破誓言，愿一切不祥逆境速现眼前，令我悔改。如 无惭无愧，明知故犯，愿无间地狱的痛苦速现眼前，令我知苦回头。</p>
