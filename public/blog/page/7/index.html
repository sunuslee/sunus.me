	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Okay, its MY FIRST BLOG FOR SCHOOL ASSINGMENT. And, what the hell is that? I dunno.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Anyway, here we go:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The first one is about a phenomenon that parents drive their kids to school and back home. Meanwhile, some statistic had been given. Such as some views of support or object.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>First of all, every garden has weeds. There is no exception that a thing is absolutely right and l00% perfect. So I think the most reasonable reasons to picking up kids are safe and saving times. Also, it is comfortable and makes a bit of more time to communicate with their kids. To this point, I cannot totally favor. But it’s an acceptable one.</p>

<p> Besides, I don’t thinks it’s a good ideal for those who wand to make their kids turn into a independent person, which is far more important than a comfortable environment or something like that.</p>

<p>  All in all, I just hope that we kids can get more spaces and time to be a man who is strong in mind and body.  Who doesn’t?</p>

<p>=====================================================================</p>

<p>DONE, I don’t know how much words I have typed, but I am sure that I reached the limit ion even beyond it, whatever.</p>

<p>========</p>

<p>Here comes the second one:</p>

<p>Well, this assignment is about a boy and a girl. They are in a peak which can see the sun rises up. While they’re seeing the scenery of the nature, one of them may say: “look, the sun is rising now. But, eventually, it will go down. And tomorrow is another day. That’s how the world works, likes life. Our lives were filled with ups and downs. We have already aware of that clearly. However, sometimes, we cannot accept our mistakes or failures. We want badly to be in the top of the mountain all the time. But No one can make it happen as he wishes. Even though he is trying hard with all might he got, but he cannot keep moving on without an obstacle. What I am going to express here is one should realize a truth that everything has its own way to work, we cannot against</p>

Those days,i lived in my grandma&#8217;s who lives in guilin.She is already turned 80,or higher,but,still healthy and happy.Espeically i can make it be with her and celebrate this festival.After she told me about this,i dont know what to say,just kept eating.Suddently,i felt like i was going to cry&#8230;. Afterwards,i started thinking about those people around me,especially the olds.My grandparents,i can not imagine how much they love me,i appreciate them.I am thankful to them,but i realized that NOT MATTER WHAT I DID,DO,GOING TO DO CANONT ENOUGH RECIPROCATE THEM.However,i will try my best to make them happy and proud of me.I promise, right now.        okay,here&#8217;s another thing to post,i asked a gril out for movie,but,in fact,i just wanted to STAND HER UP,so,i texted that&#8221;hi,how are you?Wanna a movie with me? or something like that&#8230;.Then she accepted,but set a time that i have already to town.This afternoon,i afraid that what if i get screwed up?Omfg&#8230;Who knows.Btw,if only she didnt stand me up so many times,i wouldnt do this to reward she.lol  update#1 Back home now,but,maybe,i got screwed up&#8230;.</p>

		<p>  hum&#8230;Today,i just did some exam of physics , math and Chinese.But i felt not comfortable at now.<br/>
In a word,what makes me so freak out of fucked up is The CARELESS!I hate it since i grew into a student who always has endless exams to be face.<br/>
As far I see,there is some situations i always meet and did something stupid again and again.<br/>
  To start with,when i met some easy questions,i would pride of myself.Then The CARELESS GENE  became activity and worked effective,So i can look decrease as increase etc&#8230; Just like I did it before ,even this morning.<br/>
  Next,If something makes me puzzled,i also will be lost my care.whatever. Then i came up with great ideas,The careless showed up again,which makes some IMPORTANT informations went away or just missing.What the fuck! That&#8217;s what makes me hammered the desk when the exam paper just handed in.<br/>
  Eventually,i can not put up with it,So i just bloged it.Hope anyone who can takes it away will come and take it away! <br/>
Thanks God!<br/>
Btw,today The Fucking CAreless takes almost 21scores from me.congratulations to you guys! I will pay you back!</p>

<p>===========</p>

<p>Btw #2,One of the best SWEDISH COUNTER-STRIKE 1.6 player,Known as  &#8216;zet&#8217; just cameback,but his  first performance did not as good as he used to.WHat a pity,as did I.</p>

what the fuck?! i ask myself and came up with nothing.<br/>
an half hour later,they began to warm up,then,The first competitor they gonna to versus was SK-Gaming,one of the most strongest team in the world.<br/>
It is obviously that Team Dragon not only had to conquer their physical problems but also spirits and skills.<br/>
1st round.they won,with some headshot.but it&#8217;s the only round they played quite well.<br/>
They they got totally owned!Yeah, that was a OWNAGE!<br/>
They tense,so they lose it.There is no doubt about it that No Team could make it with tenseness and physical problems even thought they well in sprite and physical.<br/>
It&#8217;s just a training match.<br/>
yep,just a training match.<br/>
just stand up and keep moving.</p>

<p>OKOK, the Grand Final is about to begin.keep turning on!<br/>

		<p><strong>&#8220;With great power comes great</strong> responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found and wrote it.As my Birthday gift for myself.yeah,now i have been turned 18.<br/>
On that day,26th of March,my Dad called me,said <br/>
&#8220;hey,soon.you are an adult now,how&#8217;s feeling? &#8221;<br/>
&#8220;so-so,not bad.and&#8230;&#8221;<br/>
&#8220;eventually,you became a grown,from this moment forwards,you can be a President if you have that ability&#8221;<br/>
&#8220;hehe haha&#8230;&#8221;<br/>
&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>let&#8217;s turn to March 30th, I had dinner,sitting on computer,wrote something i feeling that makes me &#8230;..<br/>
During the dinner,I felt great responsibility on my shoulder.There&#8217;s no doubt I will go towards my goal.<br/>
but can i?i don&#8217;t know.The real situation i meet was not good enough,rather than so-so.Although that,i will not give up,whatever how much times i fail.I am the man who never swerves from his determination to success.To manage this,i have a loooooooooong way to go.</p>

<hr />

<p>With my emotion world going down and down,my mind became stronger and stronger.I realized that no good female would put herself into a bad guy.So,just keep going,There must be a beauty wating for you,Despite when of where.It&#8217;s must exsitting.</p>

<hr />

<p>Enjoy my grown time!Make it Big and Brilliant</p>

<p>Done.</p>

		<p>Do what you plan to do and plan what you gonna to do.<br/>
sounds awesome!<br/>
get started.<br/>
The fresh start for any moment is available,so,i pick it up at  once.<br/>
Over a period of two weeks or so,i got totally failed.whatevre study or emotion,frankly,i did want to set them right,but the effeort i made far from it&#8217;s needed.Then i didn&#8217;t take actions in response to fix them,and Let them act of their owe accord.<br/>
It&#8217;s best that emotion comes of her own accord but STUDY.<br/>
when exams towards,i did something that should have done in earier days.Absolutely it doesn work.<br/>
Now,it&#8217;s a TOUGH time i have to meet.but i have never been afraid of it.soon or later,i can win,i&#8217;m born winner.<br/>
i am superb,but a little lazy in doing memorization works,As well as careless.<br/>
It was the reasons why i failed.And sometimes i loaded with anxieties.<br/>
But i am a student,i have to lead a STUDENT-STYLE life.<br/>
As a reault of above all,the highest-emergencies is do what i plan to do and plan what gonna to do.<br/>
with a stone&#8217;s far,i can easily get it.<br/>
let&#8217;s see what will happen.</p>
