  <div class="entry-content"><p>After several month&#8217;s suffering,sunus is out of school as he wished and now he is on his way home,on the train. <br/>
finally,i made up my mind to get out of school to put everything i got to what i love for years , it wasn&#8217;t as tough as you thought . but it calls for courage and supports from all aspects to make it happen .luckily , i have them both ! so right now , it is my time to spark , to let the rest of the world know what i am doing and what exactly i am capable of . of course it is a long and tough way to go , but i firmly believe in myself as i always do . No matter how the world changes ,the future of mine is bright . so , i will just code my own future .</p>

<p>I got off the train , and i will get in the plane shortly.:D</p>

<p>so wish me luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi there, it has been a while since last time I wrote blog directly on my laptop . Now i am not taking any of classes , of course its about one o’clock in the midnight ! But what i want to emphasize is that THIS blog means something to me, something that i have thought it over and over . So, i just spill it out with the rain falling down to the ground.</p>

<p>I always consider myself as one of the most OUTSTANDING guy in the campus who cherishes his time to do things that he like and matters to him. Of course that thing is always be the Programming,codes and datas for me. and i did do as i described above. But now,or more specifically , recently i spent so so so much time with girls and having fun. I don’t like the way i spent my time , because i didn’t come here to dating or hanging out with girls after all. I mean, i don’t blame any of the girls that i have met or played with. In fact , you guys are just wonderful,gorgeous and cute. Moreover some of you did attract me very much so that i just simply could not stop thinking of you for several days till i realized  you’re just a passerby in my life, or maybe not,who knows :D</p>

<p>Now , the rain just stopped but my fingers keep on typing :D</p>

<p>Despite the fact that lately i was with girls quite often , i still DO NOT think it do much harm to me . Because of that sort of shy , tacitly kid has gone,even though i don’t how far it’s , but still it’s good. Especially when i witnessed the whole progress of one of my friend’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend came to an end in such a few days, I finally realized how important it’s to know how to deal with girls,how to talk to them and so many how-to-do stuffs. I just did a better job than that tragedy roommate,So please don’t feel me like a date artist or some kind of expert or something. lol.Therefore,I just want to thank those girls i met early years,even though none of you is my girlfriend but it really really doesn’t matter at all ! i really really mean it .Your companionships are one of the most beautiful,valuable things i have ever got.  As a consequence, i bet my future girlfriend will thank you guys too,for you turn me into a nice,sweet,humors,thoughtful,considerate boyfriend,while is definitely more than qualified. (and so many adj(s) will be added long as i saw them)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to focus on what its most important to me,like i said,coding,programming and datas. That’s why i wrote this blog in such a late night, There&#8217;s something i want to be memorized while something i just want to get rid of. From now on,I will manage my times wisely and perfectly.First of all, Huffman Codes is about to come to an end.And the graph is a whole new chapter that’s to be taken care of.So, Since i have gone that far,why don’t i just go father ?</p>

<p>alright,it’s about two 2am but i think it’s worth posting a blog like this.Oh i almost forget there’s a English test tomorrow,but what the hell. I already proved myself is the BEST student in the class by the cet-4 test. i just do not have to do that thing again and again.</p>

<p>ONE LAST WORD :</p>

<p>SUNUS DE BEST!</p>

<p>good night and have a nice day :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s time to wake up and review what i have done lately . i spent so much time with girls , and it just happened on me maybe my MOJO increased or something. Consequently , i didn&#8217;t focus on my project that much , more specifically , Glists. Sadly , i am absolutely not satisfied for this and i did let someone down , someone who&#8217;s believing in me,supporting me for a long time . <br/>
so i can just get going and better finalize the Glists then move on. <br/>
that&#8217;s all,&#8230;. <br/>
peace !</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>alright , here we go , sunus in class again which guarantee you there will be another new post is being written. <br/>
about two days ago , when i just finished the first-simple version of the BOOKINDEX stuff , which i am kind of proud of it , i began to browse on the net and i found a phrase and i like sharing with you guys.</p>

<p>Take life on , One step at a time , It&#8217;s gonna happen when it suppose to.</p>

<p>AND I do believe in this , looking back the times when i encounter with C , that&#8217;s a total chaos and disaster,for countless errors and warning jumped up on screen. But now , I am just doing a better code than before , or yesterday. <br/>
Today Is April fool&#8217;s day , but i am not joking about this.hum,from tomorrow to April 5 , i am going to live a out-of-campus life with some friends , that&#8217;s just incredibly awesome ! I am looking forward to see you ! and to some of them who i have never hang out with , I feel nervous , but meanwhile , It&#8217;s fine,though.:D</p>

<p>So will you just wait and see to find out how CTS sunus is and enjoy the great time in Tianjin.</p>

<p>FYI,Right now, i just put Gnu Gcc into my N900 and it works perfect :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Classes is the only reliable guarantee that my blog will get updated so as i am in school. <br/>
Now,just in less than 15 hours , Mr..sunus will be a 20-year-old guy and now he&#8217;s under huge transforming. <br/>
even thought i don&#8217;t really what to write right now complain about teacher&#8217;s continually showing off some English stuffs he&#8217;s got. It sucks . <br/>
Therefore, i am about to read a book borrowed last night , hoping i can bring something new on the table in the next few hours.</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

<p>It turned out did work as good as i expected , so i just keep writing in my un-variable-crappy style and i still you enjoy it. <br/>
Fortunately , It&#8217;s regular blog updating day as well as the last day of the 19 year old times , Which means there&#8217;s no need to do a extra one of Birthday Special Edition that i planed to. <br/>
But,To be honest, i didn&#8217;t expect too much from my birthday , for almost getting nothing for several years and i am not sad about that anymore..As to the birthday celebration , I think , or , probably will become a feast of delicacies.then, go back to my dorm and do what i gotta do. <br/>
Still I&#8217;d love to thanks all of my friend keeping me company , no matter how long it lasted or last ,no matter online friends or offline friends , or even you&#8217;re currently taken, that&#8217;s OK as well. And that&#8217;s for sure i hope you guys will be with me forever.Because you guys are just as wonderful as i am:D and i do <br/>
enjoy the time when we were together .yeah,One more thing i kind of look forward a special guest from Wuhan , Hubei. And you know what , she&#8217;s an AIESECer! <br/>
So,That&#8217;s how it ends and hopefully something surprising happens:D</p>

<p>HAPPY HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY TO SUNUS LEE !!! <br/>
BEST OF LUCK IN THE FUTURE AS YOU ALWAYS GOT!! <br/>
IN THE END , I STILL REMEMBER THE DAY WAS A PAINFUL DAY BACK IN .20 YEARS AGO. WHEN A GREAT MOTHER WAS TRYING EXTREMELY HRAD TO BRINGING ME TO THIS WORLD. <br/>
THAT&#8217;S HOW I GOT THERE AND I LOVE YOU,MOM!NOW I HOPE I CAN MADE YOU PROUD OF ME!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I usually do not feeling once i got interrupt by noise or something like that during the sleep. That really sucks and therefore i don&#8217;t talk to them for two or three hours ! This time , There&#8217;s not any communications as usual , but i am kind of happy for some certain reasons.<br/>
First of all , i finalized the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm as well as the failure function within it and i do feel happy about it. and i also felt that the KMP was a sign or hint for me , like quicksort or Hanoi or anything else that&#8217;s just AMAZING and EFFICIENT stuffs to tell me &#8220;hey dude ! since you have already got me , why don&#8217;t you go father to find more , to acquire more ?&#8221; yep, that&#8217;s what i do . and the more i explore , the more i need to know&#8230; but still , In the chasing of something you love , you gotta get well prepared of that.<br/>
OK,let&#8217;s move on. i always consider myself as a luck one.just like i finalized the kmp , i got at least two rewards . and yeah, both of them are wonderful and i just post it in time sequence.</p>

<p>The first one is i got a message that asked me whether i had dinner or not and at the beginning i don&#8217;t really notice that. but after two or three minutes , i figured , even a rock might also realized that she&#8217;s asking me out ! and soon as we met , i also realized that she might want to something outside the school , so alright then we got to a Korean barbecue . food&#8217;s great and i admit that i have not taste it yet. so , it&#8217;s great but it didn&#8217;t fill me up ? :D<br/>
during the dinner , we talked over a couple of topics including school life , movies , plans for the future , human natures ( kind of weird , but i still think i am the good one ) and so on. so , it has been great fun when having dinner with she. and when nothing&#8217;s left on the table that&#8217;s still available to eat,we checked out and headed back to campus.</p>

<p>Good things never came alone . when i got back to my dormitory i started to browsing people&#8217;s IM status,due to i just finished the kmp , and i found a target who is suffering from the ice cream that caused her feel pain.so , remember it seems like we didn&#8217;t talk much except some smile face since she decided not to visit me due to the AIESEC team discipline or something i don&#8217;t know. so , i sent &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with you and are you feeling super hot so that you must get some ice cream during the cold season.?&#8221; so it turned out to be a good starter , and conversation began, later on i showed off a little bit that i got a girl with me to dinner and how yummy the food was. all of a sudden , I got a message “i am going to sneak out to meet you !” then , i don&#8217;t get the time to think of what just happened , not to mention how to respond it properly. because another message came instantly &#8220;i got a C problem&#8221; blah blah blah&#8230; or,maybe i should have reply something like alright then . or you’re very welcome! :D</p>

<p>the class goes on and my phone is dying. so i just make it last as long as it can.</p>

<p>Turning to twenty means a lot of to me . there&#8217;s something big coming down in the near future that is the first important decision that i have ever made for my own path. Now i just need to prove that&#8217;s the right thing to do !</p>

<p>Bye!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>this time was kind of usual , for i got to the classroom before the class begins. 0h no, Now the class began. several seconds ago, the fat,short teacher just hung out on the web to show he&#8217;s using wiki via the whole English pages. Is this wroth showing off? I can even get the latest playboy magazine..and Stanford university&#8217;s whole computer sciences classes.</p>

<p>yeah,a another week almost go away and i did acquire something new,that is,some data structs like RING,link list,double link list as well. besides,Gaining a deep understanding to the stack and heap that is tightly related to the recursion that&#8217;s huge and once you understand all of these,you can easily solve the Hanoi tower,and save the world:D but still,i still have a lot of work to do,so i left this here,to motivate me : keep strong till you get there , AND become stronger after you get there. FYI : this comes form a terrorist , funny though? <br/>
maybe,teacher &#8216;s about to get me answer a question, : umh.. i don&#8217;t really got a superstar in sports field,because i do not really care sport scene except table tennis,but as far as i know,table tennis is just belongs to those players who practice most,who scarifies most.so i really don&#8217;t see any superstar out there..ok that&#8217;s over.Teacher just moved on and i didn&#8217;t get a chance to answer it.</p>

<p>Yesterday , finally i get back (i think) a friend that i always wanted.I mean,as a cherish friend of mine , so please don&#8217;t get me wrong this time after reading those sweet words:D <br/>
then,we got to chat about the study,future,and something i think she may want do try, THE UI stuffs,lucky i know something about it ,therefore i offered some constructive suggestions (i think as well).It makes me feel great to help people,especially when the one that i cherish. <br/>
the first half is finalized.i would like to get my head up instead of fixing on the mobile device.<br/>
looking around,nothing special nothing attract me except a little gal,but,yeah i have seen plenty of them, so that&#8217;s it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>as long as i am in school,i will never be worried about my blog do not get enough updates since the English classes as boring as it should be. therefore,once again i start to post this blog with my NEW device,that is,Nokia N900 with maemo 5 operation system.please give the warmest welcome to this little but high-intelligence buddy.Now i can be far more efficient with the typing than before.</p>

<p>i should NOT have been here ! but at the last minute when the decision was about to made , i chickened out. so the flight was booked and i am here for another new semester.anyway,i got a kind of relief and it comes from my family , how strange it&#8217;s !<br/>
with many goals and plans , i keep on compromising with my own career and school stuffs. but , yeah i do not give a damn shit about the later and it&#8217;s just like a fat,ugly,old woman for me.</p>

<p>Mr.sunus moves on with both feet and eventually he will get there,get the hottest,sweet,considerate and thoughtful gal on the planet.</p>

<p>It starts with the binary search tree ^^</p>
