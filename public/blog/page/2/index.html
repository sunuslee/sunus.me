		<p>Hi, It’s been a while since the last post, isn’t it ? so many things going on those days, I got dumped , yeah, I got dumped by a very amazing and awesome girl that I’ve always talked about.</p>

<p>and some of my friends I played a lot counter-striker with are graduated from university, so no more counter-strike for a while.(OH REALL? I don’t know:D)</p>

<p>they are a bunch of nice guys and brothers to me and I am looking forward to play with them again!</p>

<p>it’s sad, but life moves on, as it always does.</p>

<p>and I came to Beijing on July 1st, (WOW! FINALLY!) I can feel that there is a very exciting , interesting and wonderful journey just right there waiting for me to explore, to experience. and I am ready to embrace all of those wonderful things! such as new opportunities, new apartments and new roommates:) i think some of them is kinda interesting, i am looking forward to meet them:)</p>

<p>let’s talk about what I did recently, finally, I choose the best offer I can get and starting to write some serious codes :) it’s fun and it just really surprise me a lot!</p>

<p>I kind of thoughts that I am kinda good at what I do, that’s coding, but when I FINALLY got here and starting working, I just found out there’s so many people are just really really good at it, too. most of them are older than me, but they just know so so so many skills than I do, I don’t know what I will become a year or two year later, hoping I can be much better than they’re now, lol !</p>

<p>the environment of my workspace is very nice, I am very very satisfied can my very first intern job can be like this. I can get a very nice sleep, and get up anytime I want, then head off to my office. because there’s no such rule that requires you have to be the office before a specific time, this is what I really love about this company! the food here is ok, but I can deal with that. by the way, the front-desk girl is kinda cute and I ACCIDENTALLY  pissed her off several times LOL!, even thought I just got here some day ago, sorry about that:(, but I really really didn’t do those things on purpose, I just don’t know much about the rules..</p>

<p>so, right now I just need to work hard and prove my worth and make more friends and pay some EXTRA attention to the relationships that may just come in, who knows LOL!</p>

<p>anyhow, I still think of you a lot, and I saw a girl like you a lot right in the subway, even thought I knew that girl isn’t you for sure, but my heart just beat faster at that moment. i now can move on with my life, hope u can do the same:)</p>

<p>see you!</p>

		<p>it had been a while since i turned 0x16. and the last week was just AMAZING for me, and i don&#8217;t even believe everything went so smooth(or i think?) and finally, wow!</p>

<p>first of all, it all started with a mail, then i got the second mail, third&#8230;. i was kinda had doubt in myself in the first place. but now. i do know that i am useful and people want me to work with them.</p>

<p>so, i went to Beijing on Friday, took some interviews and it all went smooth. so i got several options . now i am weighting all the pros and cons. some of the options do not interests me as the others. but anyway, this time i have to made up my mind on my own and whatever it ends, i won&#8217;t regret about it.</p>

<p>Now, i was about to get the intern . Making money by doing things i&#8217;ve been loving for so long. It&#8217;s time to figure out what i need to do with that girl  i always talked about, we haven&#8217;t been talk since like a months ago. i Did made a promise to myself, don&#8217;t contact her till i get the intern, i thought it might be kinda long, but somehow, i just kinda luck. so i put this second import thing of this semester on the table. hoping she still likes me:) because i will tell her how i felt about her and what i want from her.  i don&#8217;t know how this ends, but i am kinda looking forward to that moment. even if i got the bad answer, at least i will try. i have the courage to speak it out, loudly:)</p>

<p>good night, wish u have the good luck as i did in last three days.</p>

		<p>humm, i feel like i am not young anymore. but, i am still doing those &#8216;young people&#8217; stuffs that i really really feel some kinda ashamed of. so, it&#8217;s time to grow up. in fact, i know i am growing up with time goes by.
in this very moment, right before i turn to 0x16, i would like to post something, something that i wanted to say several days ago.
first of all, i am so grateful for my family for they gave me a very very nice childhood. even though sometimes i felt it just not enough, but deep down in my heart, i knew they did what they could and i will always grateful for what they&#8217;ve gave to me. i just love to have them around me!
second, i&#8217;d like to thank all of my friends, for the time we spent together, for the happiness and sadness we shared. i&#8217;m really really proud of having you guys. I will do everything i can to make you feel the same way as i do, that is, i am hoping one day, you will feel proud of having me as your friend.
one last thing, i also want to end this with something suddenly came up of my head several days ago,  to my family,  friends and the ones i love:</p>

<p>i am trying hard to to a guy that deserves you.</p>

<p>because you are just so AMAZING.</p>

<p>hope i will not let you guys down before i turn to 0x17.</p>

<p>good night:)</p>

<p>END OF 0x15.</p>

		<p>hi, i&#8217;ve got a busy week, and i still got a lot of codes to write and i am happy that i still got something to do.
the project tmenny is about to launch and my resume-generator is almost finished. in the very beginning,  i was about to write it in ruby,which i just learned those days. but quickly i found out i might do this in the language i love most, that is, C. so,i wrote so much more lines of codes than ruby/python but i love the way C codes works. simple, clear and fast. and i can figure out almost what is going on under the every line of codes.that is just feels good!</p>

<p>humm, i really miss the days when we ACTUALLY hang out together last semester. sometime i don&#8217;t feel the same way
as we&#8217;re in school while i teach you some programming stuffs or just walk with you,strange.
even though i met someone new and we had great time, still i would rather going out taking 951 with you.</p>

<p>SK failed again and some of my really good friends are going to leave this school, including the one i just met, which is pretty sad for my to accept.</p>

<p>i am not quite quitting counter-strike yet, as we haven&#8217;t been &#8216;actually&#8217; &#8216;hang out&#8217; lately, it&#8217;s fun playing counter-strike on lan. but if i got chance hanging out with you, i will definitely pick you for sure. it&#8217;s just 10 times fun than just playing game with nine guys :&lt;</p>

<p>hoping i can getting in 951 soon.
good night, gotta code tomorrow.</p>

i suddenly found out there are so many things i don&#8217;t know&#8230;.. so, gotta hurry up. and i really really don&#8217;t know what to write right now, because the whole point of writing this one is, this is the second and last part of 2011, 2012 post.and i gotta finished this because the Spring Festival so that i can embrace the future upon me:&lt;

		<p>hi there, happy new year!</p>

<p>I just got back to my dorm several hours ago , from downtown tianjin. I was with three of my best friends celebrating the upcoming new year, 2012, and we were having great fun through the last moment of 2011</p>

<p>to the very first cup of beer of 2011. cheers!</p>

<p>so, I decided to post something to end this year and open up the new year. the title,  which I think is brilliant,  If you know  some c programming language or something called ‘comma expression’, I think you will feel the same way</p>

<p>so, here we go.</p>

<p>2011, kinda a tough year for me, even though I wrote/drawn ‘hold on’ and ‘turn on’ on my 2011 edition of QQ icon. but still. not because I made one of the biggest decision of my life on my own, but I have to deal with my problems on my own. I have to learn by myself,  I have cheer me up if I was feel upset. I have to learn to earn the every opportunity out there and finally grab some of them. sometimes I failed,</p>

<p>I told no one, then just keep on reading and learning, coding.  anyway, I learn a lot from 2011 knowledge-wise and horizon-wise.</p>

<p>the later part of 2011, I don’t think much of it. I got back to tjpu, finish my education and keep on learning. my first project ended failure, but, there’s still some people love it and feel interesting, so, not a totally  failure for me. maybe, I will re-open this project someday when time’s right. my second project is under coding now, I still have faith in that, because people need a stuff like that, to keep track of there favorite shows.</p>

<p>the good part of my returning are:</p>

<p>One:</p>

<p>I still have those two best buddies out there waiting for me and help me a lot, I even doubt that I will , some day, do the same things to the others. so, I am really really feel thankful for having you two, hoping we</p>

<p>will get really drunk one day, that the way of us to celebrating out brother-ship.</p>

<p>Two:</p>

<p>that awesome girl, again. I am just feel nothing but lucky to know her and we’re still in a very very good friendship , or it’s not just friendship, I don’t know. the point is, throughout those about three months, she’s just getting better and better. just totally a new person for me,  compare to the first day I met her.  but still, I am not that BAD, am I ?</p>

<p>I know I am a good guy, I am funny,  and I can make a girl laugh a lot while we’re hanging out, and …….</p>

<p>I am ambitious and I have very clear goal  about myself deep down in my heart, but I never talked much about it with friends. so, it’s not a surprise if a girl likes me, I know that too.</p>

<p>but, she is just awesome , I can not think about another word to describe her……</p>

<p>Three:</p>

<p>I know two geek-guy through a friend’s introduction, it’s kinda a luck , I guess. they help me a lot in exams and finally, I have someone to talk about technic stuffs in school. they just let me know, even if we’re in a crap university, there are still a few people who love what their do and will to put there times and energy into it. so, I am not alone. hope we can cooperate in the future. that’s the guy I can look for if I am ready to do something serious, and it’s the best time to find your future partner in the college. I think.</p>

<p>Sum up:</p>

<p>I met three new friends this year and I love them very much</p>

<p>even thought I failed to get the this year’s internship, which I was longing for a very long time, but just look at the bright side, I got more time to learn thing, to make new friends if I had to, so, just be patient. I think when the opportunity comes again, I am having a really good shot of grab it.</p>

<p>2011 , 2011 ; part 1/2 end.</p>

<p>To be continue.</p>

		<p>um&#8230; kind of feel down today and i just don&#8217;t know why.</p>

<p>lol this semester is about to finish, and i don&#8217;t know if i meet my goal that i had for this semester. no ! i know i am far away meet my goal this semester, i kind of feel frustrated about myself. didn&#8217;t do i write any popular stuffs , btw i mean the &#8216;DBCI&#8217; here, even thought there&#8217;s a few people who like it and found it interesting ,  anyway, i will NOT give up on my first project before i know how far / bigger it will get.  i decided to REFINE during my vacation.</p>

<p>i came up with a great idea several days ago, and i found my partner. so we decide to lunch this project right after we finished our exams. hopefully, my second project will do better. and i think, at least i wanna that stuff, and there is a lot of people out there who can not write codes, will need that too.</p>

<p>i had been put my most attentions on programming and internship lately, besides those stuff i really really had a very great time with a new girl i met here,  and she is the most AWESOME 18-year-old girl i know, even thought she doesn&#8217;t like to go to cinema or play billiards. i don&#8217;t know weather i will find someone else to hang out with when i just wanna see a movie or something when i have chance. i really really don&#8217;t know that either.  oh, by the way, she is gonna learn some C skills to take a exam,  i think i somehow &#8216;encourage&#8217;  her a little bit to do so.  anyway, hope she will find something interesting / beautiful in C , during the learning process.</p>

<p>i talked a lot with my friends lately,  i found that the older i get, the more i needs them and i feel very lucky to have them around, especially right now when i feel down, my best friend , still out there chatting with me, while i am writing this post.</p>

<p>i think i am kinda weird guy, i somehow will think a lot about the girl i hang out with recently, but when we lost touch one day and several days goes by. i might just forget about her and start to looking for new one.</p>

<p>i just don&#8217;t know what i am looking for. Or i just afraid to deal with the fact that i found what i am looking for,BUT i just don&#8217;t know if i deserve this ? i don&#8217;t know..</p>

<p>i wrote so many &#8216;i don&#8217;t know&#8217; in this post, i don&#8217;t know why&#8230;</p>

<p>so, good luck and happy x-mas and new year, it&#8217;s coming soon!</p>
