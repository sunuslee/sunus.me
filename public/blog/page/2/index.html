In 2012, i have so many goals to accomplish, i don&#8217;t know if relationship is among them.even if it&#8217;s, i will eventually put it in the last of that list.
i suddenly found out there are so many things i don&#8217;t know&#8230;.. so, gotta hurry up. and i really really don&#8217;t know what to write right now, because the whole point of writing this one is, this is the second and last part of 2011, 2012 post.and i gotta finished this because the Spring Festival so that i can embrace the future upon me:&lt;

		<p>hi there, happy new year!</p>

<p>I just got back to my dorm several hours ago , from downtown tianjin. I was with three of my best friends celebrating the upcoming new year, 2012, and we were having great fun through the last moment of 2011</p>

<p>to the very first cup of beer of 2011. cheers!</p>

<p>so, I decided to post something to end this year and open up the new year. the title,  which I think is brilliant,  If you know  some c programming language or something called ‘comma expression’, I think you will feel the same way</p>

<p>so, here we go.</p>

<p>2011, kinda a tough year for me, even though I wrote/drawn ‘hold on’ and ‘turn on’ on my 2011 edition of QQ icon. but still. not because I made one of the biggest decision of my life on my own, but I have to deal with my problems on my own. I have to learn by myself,  I have cheer me up if I was feel upset. I have to learn to earn the every opportunity out there and finally grab some of them. sometimes I failed,</p>

<p>I told no one, then just keep on reading and learning, coding.  anyway, I learn a lot from 2011 knowledge-wise and horizon-wise.</p>

<p>the later part of 2011, I don’t think much of it. I got back to tjpu, finish my education and keep on learning. my first project ended failure, but, there’s still some people love it and feel interesting, so, not a totally  failure for me. maybe, I will re-open this project someday when time’s right. my second project is under coding now, I still have faith in that, because people need a stuff like that, to keep track of there favorite shows.</p>

<p>the good part of my returning are:</p>

<p>One:</p>

<p>I still have those two best buddies out there waiting for me and help me a lot, I even doubt that I will , some day, do the same things to the others. so, I am really really feel thankful for having you two, hoping we</p>

<p>will get really drunk one day, that the way of us to celebrating out brother-ship.</p>

<p>Two:</p>

<p>that awesome girl, again. I am just feel nothing but lucky to know her and we’re still in a very very good friendship , or it’s not just friendship, I don’t know. the point is, throughout those about three months, she’s just getting better and better. just totally a new person for me,  compare to the first day I met her.  but still, I am not that BAD, am I ?</p>

<p>I know I am a good guy, I am funny,  and I can make a girl laugh a lot while we’re hanging out, and …….</p>

<p>I am ambitious and I have very clear goal  about myself deep down in my heart, but I never talked much about it with friends. so, it’s not a surprise if a girl likes me, I know that too.</p>

<p>but, she is just awesome , I can not think about another word to describe her……</p>

<p>Three:</p>

<p>I know two geek-guy through a friend’s introduction, it’s kinda a luck , I guess. they help me a lot in exams and finally, I have someone to talk about technic stuffs in school. they just let me know, even if we’re in a crap university, there are still a few people who love what their do and will to put there times and energy into it. so, I am not alone. hope we can cooperate in the future. that’s the guy I can look for if I am ready to do something serious, and it’s the best time to find your future partner in the college. I think.</p>

<p>Sum up:</p>

<p>I met three new friends this year and I love them very much</p>

<p>even thought I failed to get the this year’s internship, which I was longing for a very long time, but just look at the bright side, I got more time to learn thing, to make new friends if I had to, so, just be patient. I think when the opportunity comes again, I am having a really good shot of grab it.</p>

<p>2011 , 2011 ; part 1/2 end.</p>

<p>To be continue.</p>

		<p>um&#8230; kind of feel down today and i just don&#8217;t know why.</p>

<p>lol this semester is about to finish, and i don&#8217;t know if i meet my goal that i had for this semester. no ! i know i am far away meet my goal this semester, i kind of feel frustrated about myself. didn&#8217;t do i write any popular stuffs , btw i mean the &#8216;DBCI&#8217; here, even thought there&#8217;s a few people who like it and found it interesting ,  anyway, i will NOT give up on my first project before i know how far / bigger it will get.  i decided to REFINE during my vacation.</p>

<p>i came up with a great idea several days ago, and i found my partner. so we decide to lunch this project right after we finished our exams. hopefully, my second project will do better. and i think, at least i wanna that stuff, and there is a lot of people out there who can not write codes, will need that too.</p>

<p>i had been put my most attentions on programming and internship lately, besides those stuff i really really had a very great time with a new girl i met here,  and she is the most AWESOME 18-year-old girl i know, even thought she doesn&#8217;t like to go to cinema or play billiards. i don&#8217;t know weather i will find someone else to hang out with when i just wanna see a movie or something when i have chance. i really really don&#8217;t know that either.  oh, by the way, she is gonna learn some C skills to take a exam,  i think i somehow &#8216;encourage&#8217;  her a little bit to do so.  anyway, hope she will find something interesting / beautiful in C , during the learning process.</p>

<p>i talked a lot with my friends lately,  i found that the older i get, the more i needs them and i feel very lucky to have them around, especially right now when i feel down, my best friend , still out there chatting with me, while i am writing this post.</p>

<p>i think i am kinda weird guy, i somehow will think a lot about the girl i hang out with recently, but when we lost touch one day and several days goes by. i might just forget about her and start to looking for new one.</p>

<p>i just don&#8217;t know what i am looking for. Or i just afraid to deal with the fact that i found what i am looking for,BUT i just don&#8217;t know if i deserve this ? i don&#8217;t know..</p>

<p>i wrote so many &#8216;i don&#8217;t know&#8217; in this post, i don&#8217;t know why&#8230;</p>

<p>so, good luck and happy x-mas and new year, it&#8217;s coming soon!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hey hi, long time no see again it’s been busy months after I got here. I got here early but still got soooo much crap paper work to do.when I got all of those stuffs done. I suddenly felt like , oh god. why are you get back to this crap-land and why the hell did you gain after those days?</p>

<p>when those feeling gone, I just got some ideas to keep working on my APP,aka ‘DBCI’. so the DBCI and polo fulfilled my days a lot. now the &#8216;DBCI&#8217; , I think it’s kinda like my FIRST MAJOR PROJECT , the one that I think people will actually like, feel it interesting and use it sometime for a while. as I wrote in my resume, I want to writing something that people like, I didn’t realize that day just CAME, now I just need a partner to do some UI stuff and promote it a little bit. I think it could be huge!</p>

<p>besides ‘DBCI’, I met some interesting girls that I can hang out with,that’s is just GREAT. for a guy like me don’t usually go to class , don’t usually talk to girls that not familiar with before, is hard to find girls like I have right now to hang out with. I am not saying I am not interesting or funny or attractive. I just do know where my ‘in’ is.</p>

<p>and I really really want say thank to my best brothers in tjpu, I am so so honored to know you two, I will never forget your help when I got here alone!</p>

<p>I think that’s all ! this place sucks.but I still need to find a way out, to somewhere that I truly belonged to. peace, hope my ‘DBCI’ will grow up soon and have a nice day!</p>

<p>and i just had a really nice day with you.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A little tip:</p>

<p>If you are a guy , or you are NOT into me at all, you can just ignore this blog.</p>

<p>yeah, i figure i have to finished this post before i get going..</p>

<p>i said &#8220;i must get a serious girlfriends this semester!&#8221; some time ago to a friend , and i have some requirements for this very special girl.</p>

<p>First of all:</p>

<p>you MUST be gook-looking, i mean you can be cute, be beautiful,be attractive or sexy . that&#8217;s all right . if i ask you out  to a movie or dinner, that means I think she is GOOD-LOOKING to ME!</p>

<p>then, here comes the second stage, i want you to have some of these qualities list below :</p>

<p>(these are the ones that really matter to me, more important than your appearance)</p>

<p>0: don&#8217;t be evil.</p>

<p>1: thoughtful and considerate to others</p>

<p>2: have ability to think independently, have your own opinions</p>

<p>3: have good sense of humor</p>

<p>4: at least have basic computer skill, if you are a coder, programmer-to-be or computer science relevant major , that&#8217;s just great . if you like      writing programs/codes , or research in ALGORITHM, that&#8217;s just AWESOME!!!!!(i really mean it, that&#8217;s what a girl that i longing for days looks like) and i won&#8217;t repair your computer/phones for more than 3 TIMES!</p>

<p>5: love movies or American TV shows like:</p>

<p>[24, The big bang theory,  How i met your mother, Leverage,  It crowds,  Spartacus, Gossip girl and PORNS:D:D!!]</p>

<p>then we may have more topic to chat about.</p>

<p>6: knowing stuffs, like how two people to maintain their relationship, what can do and what can NOT do, that&#8217;s important especially when we</p>

<p>decided to start a relationship.</p>

<p>7: respect people&#8217;s privacy, that mean i will NEVER give out my IM account, Email account, Social Networks account, etc. and i won&#8217;t ask you</p>

<p>for these infos, neither.</p>

<p>8: if you are a Hardcore Counter-Strike player , polo beginner or a programmer/coder , that will SIGNIFICANTLY  increase my impression of you.</p>

<p>9:at lease understand what i wrote above , with or without the help of any kinds of TRANSLATOR. i know there&#8217;s a lot a grammar mistake inside this blog,  if you can point it out, i appreciate it</p>

<p>Lastly, please do keep this in mind:</p>

<p>if i ask you out to a movie or dinner for the FIRST time, it just , just means i think you are good-looking to me, nothing less, nothing more.It takes days to build up a serious relationship.</p>

<p>thanks  for reading this long piece-of-crap-blog-if-you-are-not-into-me lol</p>

<p>have a good day! sweetie!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I came up with this title a few days ago, that’s when I decided to write this post, to summary those extraordinary days.</p>

<p>Finally ! I get back to this damn school, continue my education , as I promised to my family.</p>

<p>It has been a long and tough journey , I’d been lonely , helpless , hesitating and sometimes lost.but now,I am still here and ready to fly there , then keep on fighting.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I did what I thought a year ago or I got what I thought I want a year ago, anyway it’s a tough year and I made it through. I did GAIN my skill a lot, including polo</p>

<p>I TRY to grab some opportunities , but when I mean I TRY, I think u may know what it ended. so, I get back in the game with nothing and a extra year, not good but wtf, I don’t give it a shit as always.</p>

<p>Meego , Youdao and Tencent I think you just made a BIG MISTAKES! anyway, I still like Meego!</p>

<p>Wired me! I suddenly feel like I have nothing to write about , except to give some really really BIG thanks to those wonderful people that keep me company through those days , you guys really really just wonderful and I can not thank you enough! I really enjoyed the times when we hung out together and I will NEVER forget you.</p>

<p>One more thing, just some days before I get back to Tianjin, I came up a VERY VERY COOOOL idea . I made it come into real codes and it just about to get started ! if you are a Douban.com member and wanna try something cool stuff, u can ask me to try this cool stuff before anyone else does. It’s a python program and now need someone to make it into a beautiful HTML page.</p>

<p>This is my first time I feel that I can really do something that is cool and people may like it.</p>

<p>Last, after this long journey, I think I really really need some girlfriend , so watch out ,girls ! I will soon post another blog about “What kind of girl that I will ask her out on a date”.</p>

<p>So, thanks for reading!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>hummm&#8230;</p>

<p>Once again, no long time no update.</p>

<p>but this time is special , because i just send this blog&#8217;s address to a girl, a girl that i have crush on from 9.2010 to now. :D</p>

<p>ok, let&#8217;s get started!</p>

<p>first of all, it&#8217;s 4,may 2011 now. it&#8217;s been a while and i think now i feel kinda ready to embrace the new opportunities and challenges . hopefully u can see me in Shanghai in next few days.Wish me luck!</p>

<p>I think i really did work hard in the past few week , i wrote a c library with some common data structure and algorithms and it can handle all data types.</p>

<p>and i make a little &#8216;peer to peer&#8217;_chat tool named &#8220;talk2gals&#8221; , but now it can ONLY running on linux/unix Operating System now , because some portable issues. but it&#8217;s not that hard to make it run on windows as long as i find the girl who&#8217;s willing to use it to chat with me:D</p>

<p>I read so many books recently , i found them benefit me a lot ,i never felt i like reading book like this time before or let&#8217;s just say before i get in university.i can freely read the book i like for my own good rather that for those suck exams.</p>

<p>i just found my english-writing skill is kinda decaying.</p>

<p>so i just put a SONG that i really really love to listing those days :</p>

<p>Play on , Sung by Carrie UnderWood from her album Play On.</p>

<p><strong>[00:36.04]Where you&#8217;re gonna reach when the goal gets higher</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:38.53]How you&#8217;re gonna make it through</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:40.39]When you think you lost your chance</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:42.62]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:43.00]Play on when you&#8217;re losing the game</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:48.08]Play on &#8216;cause you&#8217;re gonna make mistakes</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:53.56]It&#8217;s always worth the sacrifice</strong></p>

<p><strong>[00:56.79]Even when you think you&#8217;re wrong</strong></p>

<p><strong>[01:03.70]So play on&#8230;</strong></p>

<p><strong>here is a link for this GREAT HIT :</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://music.sina.com.cn/yueku/i/1234878.html"><strong>http://music.sina.com.cn/yueku/i/1234878.html</strong></a></p>

<p>ok,i hope u enjoy it and see you next time!my friends.</p>

<p>Girls are getting pretty than ever ! some of them i can still remember what&#8217;  they’re look like or sound like . maybe some of them will stay in my memory  forever,just like ROM ^<sup>.</sup> yeah,that’s true. It’s not embarrassing to said  that,’cause it has been years and just let the past pass.we all have moved  on!</p>

<p>Boy are getting mature.and we ‘re really having a great time @ party .  The beers didn’t waste a single drip:D</p>

<p>The only thing that i considered as a pity is that there’s a girl,a girl that  i really really want to have a talk with,did NOT show up:&lt;…. sigh,hoping  there’s always another chance out there for me . I just want to have a talk with  her,that’s it.</p>

<p>I am really having a great time this night and i love you all!</p>

<p>UPDATE: We are going to do it AGAIN! IT&#8217;S GONNA BE CRAZY! CAN’T WAIT TO SEE  U!</p>
