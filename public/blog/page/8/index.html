		<p>uh,in fact,actually,i wrote this bolg in a few days ago.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>  The Chinese new year of 2009  Now,i am sitting in a car，which will arrive in liuzhou within one hour. Those days,i lived in my grandma&#8217;s who lives in guilin.She is already turned 80,or higher,but,still healthy and happy.Espeically i can make it be with her and celebrate this festival.After she told me about this,i dont know what to say,just kept eating.Suddently,i felt like i was going to cry&#8230;. Afterwards,i started thinking about those people around me,especially the olds.My grandparents,i can not imagine how much they love me,i appreciate them.I am thankful to them,but i realized that NOT MATTER WHAT I DID,DO,GOING TO DO CANONT ENOUGH RECIPROCATE THEM.However,i will try my best to make them happy and proud of me.I promise, right now.        okay,here&#8217;s another thing to post,i asked a gril out for movie,but,in fact,i just wanted to STAND HER UP,so,i texted that&#8221;hi,how are you?Wanna a movie with me? or something like that&#8230;.Then she accepted,but set a time that i have already to town.This afternoon,i afraid that what if i get screwed up?Omfg&#8230;Who knows.Btw,if only she didnt stand me up so many times,i wouldnt do this to reward she.lol  update#1 Back home now,but,maybe,i got screwed up&#8230;.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>FINALLY, MR.sunus got screwed up. lol tatolly screwed up.</p>

<p>in relationship fields,i just got dumpped.and that fine,in fact we are not match each other at all! Sooner we parted,better to come earlier.</p>

<p>some of my classmates went wild,and i just leave them alone,i knew i cant change their minds or something.so i just keep being who i am and tring to be better and better.i always said to myself,once i come to top,i would never fall down.though i am sill climbing with blood and ters,but i definitely believe that one day i must be amply rewarded.</p>

<p>plus.i meet a little nice girl from america,i knew something about american brands,shows etc from her,that&#8217;s funny.</p>

<p>sometimes,we had have some misunderstanding in conversation.but not that much,and it&#8217;s not a super big deal,lol</p>

		<p>  hum&#8230;Today,i just did some exam of physics , math and Chinese.But i felt not comfortable at now.<br/>
In a word,what makes me so freak out of fucked up is The CARELESS!I hate it since i grew into a student who always has endless exams to be face.<br/>
As far I see,there is some situations i always meet and did something stupid again and again.<br/>
  To start with,when i met some easy questions,i would pride of myself.Then The CARELESS GENE  became activity and worked effective,So i can look decrease as increase etc&#8230; Just like I did it before ,even this morning.<br/>
  Next,If something makes me puzzled,i also will be lost my care.whatever. Then i came up with great ideas,The careless showed up again,which makes some IMPORTANT informations went away or just missing.What the fuck! That&#8217;s what makes me hammered the desk when the exam paper just handed in.<br/>
  Eventually,i can not put up with it,So i just bloged it.Hope anyone who can takes it away will come and take it away! <br/>
Thanks God!<br/>
Btw,today The Fucking CAreless takes almost 21scores from me.congratulations to you guys! I will pay you back!</p>

<p>===========</p>

<p>Btw #2,One of the best SWEDISH COUNTER-STRIKE 1.6 player,Known as  &#8216;zet&#8217; just cameback,but his  first performance did not as good as he used to.WHat a pity,as did I.</p>

what the fuck?! i ask myself and came up with nothing.<br/>
an half hour later,they began to warm up,then,The first competitor they gonna to versus was SK-Gaming,one of the most strongest team in the world.<br/>
It is obviously that Team Dragon not only had to conquer their physical problems but also spirits and skills.<br/>
1st round.they won,with some headshot.but it&#8217;s the only round they played quite well.<br/>
They they got totally owned!Yeah, that was a OWNAGE!<br/>
They tense,so they lose it.There is no doubt about it that No Team could make it with tenseness and physical problems even thought they well in sprite and physical.<br/>
It&#8217;s just a training match.<br/>
yep,just a training match.<br/>
just stand up and keep moving.</p>

<p>OKOK, the Grand Final is about to begin.keep turning on!<br/>

		<p><strong>&#8220;With great power comes great</strong> responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found and wrote it.As my Birthday gift for myself.yeah,now i have been turned 18.<br/>
On that day,26th of March,my Dad called me,said <br/>
&#8220;hey,soon.you are an adult now,how&#8217;s feeling? &#8221;<br/>
&#8220;so-so,not bad.and&#8230;&#8221;<br/>
&#8220;eventually,you became a grown,from this moment forwards,you can be a President if you have that ability&#8221;<br/>
&#8220;hehe haha&#8230;&#8221;<br/>
&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>let&#8217;s turn to March 30th, I had dinner,sitting on computer,wrote something i feeling that makes me &#8230;..<br/>
During the dinner,I felt great responsibility on my shoulder.There&#8217;s no doubt I will go towards my goal.<br/>
but can i?i don&#8217;t know.The real situation i meet was not good enough,rather than so-so.Although that,i will not give up,whatever how much times i fail.I am the man who never swerves from his determination to success.To manage this,i have a loooooooooong way to go.</p>

<hr />

<p>With my emotion world going down and down,my mind became stronger and stronger.I realized that no good female would put herself into a bad guy.So,just keep going,There must be a beauty wating for you,Despite when of where.It&#8217;s must exsitting.</p>

<hr />

<p>Enjoy my grown time!Make it Big and Brilliant</p>

<p>Done.</p>

Over a period of two weeks or so,i got totally failed.whatevre study or emotion,frankly,i did want to set them right,but the effeort i made far from it&#8217;s needed.Then i didn&#8217;t take actions in response to fix them,and Let them act of their owe accord.<br/>
It&#8217;s best that emotion comes of her own accord but STUDY.<br/>
when exams towards,i did something that should have done in earier days.Absolutely it doesn work.<br/>
Now,it&#8217;s a TOUGH time i have to meet.but i have never been afraid of it.soon or later,i can win,i&#8217;m born winner.<br/>
i am superb,but a little lazy in doing memorization works,As well as careless.<br/>
It was the reasons why i failed.And sometimes i loaded with anxieties.<br/>
But i am a student,i have to lead a STUDENT-STYLE life.<br/>
As a reault of above all,the highest-emergencies is do what i plan to do and plan what gonna to do.<br/>
with a stone&#8217;s far,i can easily get it.<br/>

		<p>pou them seems like a little bit late,but whatever,you can read them.</p>

<p>Wow there&#8217;s two days after my landed.it&#8217;s wonderful that I can said.The building HERE are high and modern or a little beyond the time that i live at. and what about Liuzhou,hmmmmmm don&#8217;t mention it.two cities that just do not compare.also the goods here are higher prize.damn it.</p>

<p>but the way,the girl who i miss so much now accepted my invite to my b-day,and with my turns to 1 8 .i got so nervous and excited,but.. what&#8217;s the hell,let it be and face it.</p>

<p>======================<br/>
hummmmmmm,what&#8217;s the fuck bus of beijing,the CAPITAL OF NATION.three buses PASSED ME LIKE A WIND,A WILD WIND.i felt i have had a war when i got in the bus.also likes procreating when i tried hardly for the litte room. but,i know the girl a little more than yesterdat,who next to me,she&#8217;s not bad,humm.  she got my qq number,wow.and i show her my school where i study in.she&#8217;s suprised. it&#8217;s really funny.<br/>
The new teacher , that&#8217;s not bad.but i am better in physics,i am FULLY CERTAIN OF IT.<br/>
ok,that all i can MEMORIZE,its time to sleep. good DREAM,Mr.sunus.</p>

<p>==============================</p>

<p>what a nice day i had  ,that&#8217;s what i want to say.hummm,i downloaded two games called Miniblaster and PuzzleBobbleVS.but in fact,the PuzzleBobbleVS was such a game that i don&#8217;t know how to Play.and hard to set up because of the low MEMORY.WTF? fortunately,i got Miniblaster,the game attracted her a lot, i think. so,we played together and against.obviously,i won the game  eventually.palapalala&#8230;<br/>
btw,with a pity,i intented to invite her for hanging out, play or see a movie.but i couldn&#8217;t catch any  apporunity TO SAY THAT.I WISH I HAD SAID,EVEN IF GOT REFUSED.DAMN IT</p>

<p>HUMMMM,IT&#8217;S 11:56  P.M. TIME TO SLEEP,SEE YO GUYS.</p>

<p>==========================<br/>
  Actually,today was not bad. we got closer by the MiNIblaster. She seems to be attracted by THE LITTLE BOMBER.wow i couldn&#8217;t imagine that. Still,it&#8217;s so lovely that i had no reason to refused to played with , also i find the game was more and more interesting , so we played againist.Boom Boomm Boom&#8230;.As she said beford the game get started that she had trained and passed to the level eight.She became stronger,apparently.So i pay more attention on it,but&#8230; ehhh  games is for boys even if she got powerful-bomb that is what i had to say after some rounds.however, she did many real&#8217;ly great planted that the bomb around me.So skilled she was.<br/>
  There&#8217;s some interesting and funny SCENE worth to mentioning that we two bomber stood in the one box and face two bomer IT MEANS ALL OF US WERE GONNO TO DIE.it was dismay to her but me.Because i got two liVES ,lol.and sometimes we did the same things that went a same route,planted in the same box,etc.When that happened,she laughted and said something like &#8220;don&#8217;t follow me,you jackass,don&#8217;t take my  target&#8221; .. i will let her win more tomorrow,I think.<br/>
  And pity as yesterdat,as I always did,i had no courage to invited she for play outside,maybe there&#8217;s now chance to said.but however,the apporunity needed caught by oneself,doesn&#8217;t it?<br/>
  By the way, i became weaker and weaker in count-strike that i have been playing for almost five years. HeatoN had gone,so does the man that I used to be.<br/>
  By the way again,CJ7 IS SUCH A WONDERFUL MOVIE WHICH IMPRESSED ME A LOT.even though it was no as funny as chou&#8217;s movies.<br/>
  that&#8217;s all.good dream and headshot.</p>

<p>====================<br/>
  yeah,i sent my contact card to her as a gift.i got nervous when i said &#8220;humm,i would give you a present as the new year gift&#8221;..wow,but finally,i sent and she received.BTW we got  four days-off.that&#8217;s great.i can have enough sleep again.<br/>
  humm,i have the cable tv repaired,what a genius i was.wow,but i almost damaged my cellphone,it shocked me a lot.God blessed~<br/>
 Tomorrow, i will pick up my mom.LONG TIME NO SEE,I MISS HER A LOT</p>
