	<h1 class="title">The Introduction to My New 4th English Notebook.</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>  I came up with this idea that i needed a 4th English notebook on several days ago. In fact,I would rather call it &#8220;stupid log&#8221; than a regular notebook that i already have three. Due to the National colleges entrance exam,I have to grab every single point that i can possibly lose by bad luck or something .Even thought,I still can do it well without those points and far beyond average standard. But,some stupid mistakes that such as countable/uncountable words,strange expressions and grammar rules i will make are avoidable.As long as i keep recording them by myself in beautiful hand-writing.</p>

<p>  When it comes to hand-writhing,There is a lot of things  to talk about. Fabulous as my writhing skill is,it still didn&#8217;t satisfy judge&#8217;s requirement.Or in otherr word,when teacher,who teaches my English,reviewed my essays usually said that&#8221;Except your poor handwriting and some small mistakes,its a pretty good one ,etc.Finally,It always earned some extra points which won&#8217;t be counted at all.Because they,who judge my essays, like beautiful handwriting more than native expressions,they like easier sentences than complicated clause or some exactly accurate words that i thought a lot. It seems like ridiculous that a beautiful handwriting beats everything, Including those skills that most students didn&#8217;t and won&#8217;t have.In order to ACTIVATE those sentences, i will practise handwriting when i log those stupid mistakes. </p>

<p>  Last but not least,In case of i have nothing to review before exams take place,this stupid log finally showed up.  Hopefully it will work. Depend on those facts,I got this notebook and wrote this introduction. It&#8217;s pretty funny,uhh? </p>

<p>  Good Luck!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Btw,This stupid log with everything that within it will be auto-DESTORYED on 08/06/09. </p>
