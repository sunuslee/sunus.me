	<div class="entry-content"><p>yeah,as the title goes, Sunus&#8217; 12years elementary studying times is OFFICIALLY over. Now,it&#8217;s 4am,a middle night i just could not get into sleep.i was charged with tons of energy by that SMS. so i feel obliged to write something,something that i can release my real feelings.</p>

<p>    OK,Let&#8217;s begin with the challenges i have faced.Every time when i meet a new challenge,especially some big,important ones,I can not put the best of myself into it and eventually the results came with a surprise,a damn annoying  surprise just made things became a total mess.Then,something turned around.I began to find the good sides of the situations which seem rather bad in the first place.As a consequence of that kind of thing,i just GOT THROUGH those challenges with ACCEPTABLE final results. And time proved it for several times.Alright,then,Such is life,whether you struggle for a high level or go to hell.</p>

<p>     Then,I want talk about the good college.As we all know,A tons of challenges out there,the good ones,the bad ones,or the finest ones,etc.But it&#8217;s absolutely not the only way to success.Many people,great people made their names in the history,didn&#8217;t finish the college education.I put those examples on here just want to convey this very point that &#8220;Some people just meant to be somebody,No matter what college he gets in.&#8221; Besides,I said that do not only because I want to encourage myself but also encourage those who was bothered by the future or colleges or something like that.There must be a reason for you that why things went on like this,maybe,It&#8217;s god&#8217;s perfect plan? Believe me,It&#8217;s a path that towards something great,but you just did NOT see it thoroughly right now. hum,it&#8217;s 5.21 am,i feel a little tried.so i decide to get some sleep right away.Tomorrow is the another day and the SUMMER BREAK officially begins! Let&#8217;s rock!</p>

<p>      BTW,i will put that damn SMS on this blog as soon as everything settle down.so , just wait and see how lucky i am to got that fabulous scores:&lt;</p>

<p>Peace and out.</p>
