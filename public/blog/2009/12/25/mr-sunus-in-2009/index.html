	<div class="entry-content"><p>Alright,since the desk is shaking all the time which bothers me from sleeping,i decide to launch my last series blog of 2009 , also the first one of next coming year,2010.The title been made for one or two days or so.It is 2009,The good,the bad and the funny. And i will post several events with the order of good,bad,ugly.    </p>

<p><em><strong>The Good,The bad and the funny:D</strong></em></p>

<p>Round one:</p>

<p>Good: </p>

<p>i got in a university,even though it&#8217;s the one i longed for.But you know what? Only when i actually started off my college life can i truly realize it might makes no different to me if i got in a more renowned one or something like that.For me,Studying by myself is the most part of my life right now,For there&#8217;s not much left to learn in campus,for me. And i do proud of myself.and it&#8217;s the place where i can actually shine. I never feel the same way since elementary school,or junior school. So,it was absolutely a good one.  </p>

<p>Bad:</p>

<p>i am immature in quite many aspects.I was conscious of that just one or two weeks ago,kind of late?Unum..For i have done or said something reckless.Let the details remain un-public. But i do did it wrong. </p>

<p>Funny:</p>

<p>wow,there&#8217;s a lot to laugh about.I&#8217;d present it in various ways. In round one,here’s some pictures:</p>

<p><a href="https://npjmcw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1m9O8cPPehs5SlzMmwZpcNJIQhMRuJKAXEymPPcE4795laKIo7qgCtHIUrEmyLOWt6-JrJSlT35Vpq5S-CvFn_Mssx59gNexp_kbYL19NuRE3bFaKw3Zx6PrP-QVf4SQ740IZ-WIDAlWrbDwS0gyW1DQ/1%20(2"><img src="https://npjmcw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1mxWDN2RvCyDP2Gaf2EpJubx4US7aTmNWaQt6w0TzQiSCo6Ym5T71u8J9P4mEsEhZaICjYZjymFDjCwuldpCPYtXiv0xWRWMhYywGn_HZvAXxIbNAruAP3ghJgVEDhvOlTSyTTgONiSzwcSOwYbS5fwQ/1%20(2" alt="" />_thumb.jpg)</a>[2].jpg) <a href="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/002e2943107fb9a986fa9660385d9f70.jpg"><img src="http://sunus.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/002e2943107fb9a986fa9660385d9f70.jpg?w=251" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Round two:</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<p>i saved,or renewed some friendships that i lost in 2008.Without those wonderful guys my life would get tough,lonely,humdrum,helpless.</p>

<p>Life’s wonderful with you in this world.And now i wish all of you guys best of luck and having fun everyday!Last but not least,get healthier as hell :D</p>

<p> </p>

<p>stay tuned! and i gonna get drunk!</p>

<p><strong>Bad</strong>:i
am still thinner than average.No matter how hard i tried to eat , feast
was the only thing left.Which means i just could gain weight DAMN IT!</p>

<p><strong>Funny:</strong>Otaku..Obviously
it&#8217;s a Japanese term,but in some certain circumstances it can be very
funny.There&#8217;s one i got as below: A:i couldn&#8217;t go to her speech,because
i am kinda OTAKU. B:oh&#8230;I see. O ta ku( the same pronunciation as
Chinese,means oh,she/he cries.. )&#8230;.So brilliant,isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h3>Round3:</h3>

<p>Good:</p>

<p>Away
from home indeed has some benefits.Such as lead a life on my own way,i
purchase stuffs for myself,skip WISELY ,and have soup&#8230;.From all of
those you can find that,i am not the same guy since i touchdown in
Beijing.Not to mention i can buy medicine for myself which has never
ever happened to me.Quite incredible,even i gotta say so.But still,all
man needs a family to complete himself,to take considerable care of it</p>

<p>Bad:STAY TUNED!skipping happens in campus all the time.Some got caught,some got
away.Unfortunately,i got caught for several times.Especially there&#8217;s a time,once
i just skipped,less than 5minutes,the teacher began taking attendance.What the
F?</p>

<p>Final round:</p>

<p>Its 31st,Dec,the last day of 2009.Also means this so called 2009 summary
will come to an end.so all in all,There was not so many bad things happened to
me,which i thought it was.</p>

<p>On the other hand,so many great guys keep me company
and it does feel good! In fact,i could easily call up various funny,good thing
any second while i am writing it.I don&#8217;t even know which to post at all so,last
thing i would like to post is something about programming progresses i have
made.I coded a little,tiny stuff that can convert from day to date,or date to
day.E.g..The 85th days of 2010 is Fri,26th,March.</p>

<p>And i coded a HOME-MADE series
string functions.I am kinda proud of it.Besides,using Reverse Polish Notation to
make a lousy calculator also included.</p>

<p>I am still working on qsort,known as
quick-sort.This project lasts for about 20hours or so and last night i started
it over.In order to make lite,and efficient&#8230;.. All right,since there&#8217;s so many
left in 2009 but i can&#8217;t post. It&#8217;s time to say happy new year,best luck and
wish you guys succeed in whatever you do.</p>

<p>To my greatest mom,dad,grandpa and
family,i am always thinking of you .The unconditional love you put on me i would
never forget,i can never completely pay it back.But one thing is certain,i will try and let you see what this man is capable of!</p>

<p>Happy New year! BOOM ! BOOM BOOM!</p>

<p><END></p>
