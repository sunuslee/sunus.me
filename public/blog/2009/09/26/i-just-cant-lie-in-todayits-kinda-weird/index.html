	<h1 class="title">I Just Can't Lie-in Today,it's Kinda Weird.</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Now,it’s about 11am,while sunus has already got up for almost one or two hours,that’s say,he didn’t lie in on the Saturday.Kinda strange for him,isn’t it?</p>

<p>  Maybe,the only reason for this can’t-lie-in case is the military training that request we to get up before 6am and get everything’s ready and then get everything’s done within next 20minutes.It sucks.So,A sleep lasts for 7 or 8 hours for me Was absolutely not enough Now it has just become a feast for me.And i have no idea whether it’s good or not.Just let it be,i guess.</p>

<p>hum,above this is my opener for this least blog.We can finally go right straight to the things i wanted share with your guys that’s about my whole new university life @ TJPU.</p>

<p>First of all,the military training has came to an end which means we’re officially being a university student.It’s cool,actually.As far as i can see,there’s tons of free time to do the things you like and new people to meet,no more high-school-style.For me,to program stuffs also pretty interesting,I mean i just do not reach that level to programming software now,but i will,i definitely will as long as i keep my energy up and desire to achieve this dream.</p>

<p>Then,My dormitory also good for me,expect some litter collision.fortunately it’s none of my business.so i just wait and see what’s going on out there.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about another stuffs happened around the campus which is i met two girls within a half month.It’s a big break-through for my sociability compare with the past.hum,both of them are as wonderful as i expected before i finally met them,except one of them is kinda smaller than i saw on her <a href="mailto:profile@web.%20The">profile@web. The</a> other one is pretty old for me and that what she thought before we met.She treat me sometime like she is my sister. i think i will prove the simply fact that’s SHE IS WRONG. Though she’s got a brother as old as my and just didn’t get through the Nation College Examination to TJPU. That’s really,really  good ,i mean, i have no any judgement on him,i just glad we didn’t become classmate:d or i will definitely be treated like her brother.</p>

<p>Okay,i will go out for lunch with a couple of guys come from my province ,peace!</p>

<p>STAY TUNED! Love you!</p>
