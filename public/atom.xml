    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I am writing this in my new kind-of-awesome apartment in Hangzhou, a city where i could live for a while.</p>

<p>I got here a week ago and I celebrate my 0x18th birthday with a friend i made in Hangzhou. she even brought me a birthday cake, which she insisted  to do so.</p>

<p>On my birthday, I went to Xixi National Park, It has a great landscape with trees, flowers and lakes. The air is great as well, not like downtown in Hangzhou. The funny part was, when i ready to get out of the park, i decide to walk, because i thought i could do this but, in the end i almost got lost and my phone is dying, luckily I saw a shuttle. Otherwise, you might not able to see this post:)</p>

<p>Another thing is I rented an awesome apartment, it&#8217;s so great and it even got a digital panel in the room, it can controal all the electrical devices in the room, it&#8217;s really amazing! and i did a lot of housework as well, because i will live in this apartment for some time, i don&#8217;t want it to be a mass.</p>

<p>And the last thing is, i will sign up for Alibaba tomorrow, finally, wow. I don&#8217;t know what my days will be, but i think it will be so much funny &amp; exciting! Let&#8217;s wait and see.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good morning to you all:)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been back to university for some days, and i just had a really great fun in Happy-Valley in Tianjin with my new friend:)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always enthusiasm about for stuffs like Happy-Valley since I was a kid. When I started my university here, I&#8217;ve been to Beijing&#8217;s Happy-Valley for some times. That was fun! Now, I <strong>finally</strong> had a chance to go to Tianjin&#8217;s Happy-Valley, which I dreaming for some time:) I really mean it, so thank you, my friend came with me to this wonderful &amp; exciting place.</p>

<p>So, we had a great hot-pot in one of my favorite restaurants then went to the hotel the other night. That hotel is great with a giant lobby.</p>

<p>Thanks to me to pick this hotel which is only a few steps away from the Happy-Valley.</p>

<p>Then, the adventure began. We almost played all the stuffs except those that are suspended due to some maintaining reasons.</p>

<p>The roller coasters, haunted houses, etc.. That were so exciting which I haven&#8217;t experienced for some years and now, I am feeling that again, just like a teenager:) Finally, I got wetted.</p>

<p>I am just feeling I am still younger and energetic:) and thank you, my new friends for spending your time with me. That&#8217;s a fantastic experience.</p>

<p>PS, I found a cool stuff call 「<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instax">Instax</a>
」, it&#8217;s a kind of cameras that can produce the actual photos instantly. No wonder so many gift tips for girls recommend it. it&#8217;s just interesting and looks cute! i&#8217;d love to buy one some time:)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I am having a really really awesome vacation now and I met some really really attractive girls that i wished we could met earlier! That&#8217;s why I am not coding as much as i used to.</p>

<p>Basically, i met a girl that almost fit every criteria in my &#8220;LIST&#8221; for what kind of girl i wanna be with.</p>

<ul>
<li>She looks nice and attractive, especial her eyes.</li>
<li>She is a fan of Taylor Swift, She once taught me to sing Taylor&#8217;s songs, but <strong>my voice</strong> ruined everything:)</li>
<li>She majored in Math &amp; economics, which some sort of means that she is not dumb:) and now she is a Math teacher.</li>
<li>She loves to eat delicious foods.</li>
<li>We share some common interests, it&#8217;s really rare in this city.</li>
<li>We sometime chat for hours in the late night and say goodbyes.</li>
<li>She has plans for her future.</li>
<li>I&#8217;d been in her <strong>bedroom</strong> for like one or two minutes<sup>^</sup></li>
<li>blah..blah</li>
</ul>


<p>I feel really really sad for the fact that we&#8217;re working &amp; living in two <strong>different</strong> cities and there&#8217;s not much time left for us:(</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know much about each other yet, but I think she might found me interesting as well, sometimes when we hang out i could felt that she cared for me on purpose, just like someone I used to be with, then I pretended like i don&#8217;t know. LOL. but I once try to set her up with my best friend which pissed her off, now my friend is kinda fall in love with her, that&#8217;s really funny! I don&#8217;t know how i felt when i saw two of them flirting in front of me. anyway, since i am not able to stay in this city, there&#8217;s no chance for us to do this long distance thing:( that&#8217;s life, hum?</p>

<p>So, I start to hoping my life in Hangzhou could be wonderful.</p>

<p>that&#8217;s it, good night:)</p>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2014/01/01/summary-for-2013-and-resolutions-for-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just enjoyed the new year&#8217;s eve with my friends in University, which i am about to graduate in a few months later.</p>

<p>Last night was fun and I will definitely tell that story about &#8220;You have got to be talented enough if you want to be a pro DOTA player&#8221;, to my friends and spread to the world:)</p>

<p>All right, this post is about the Last year and 2014.</p>

<h3>2013 The Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>First and foremost, I got a pretty good offer this year, so i got less worried about the things after my graduation.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides that, I made some really good friends this year which i haven&#8217;t know them in the first 3 years of my university life. They are kinda awesome, by the way. We all know they we might not gather very often in the future and we all went separate ways. But friendships are forever. Our friendship will not just fade away, i believe.</p></li>
<li><p>I started to using Apple Products, they looks cool and made my life &amp; work more productive than before. Even though I am not officially having any kinds of JOBS in 2013. But i did write a lot of codes, i guess:) and since i&#8217;ve got an offer right after my graduation, I think i will continue to buy new Apple Products when their new devices come out. Still, I believe in those experiences i have in Linux is the main factor make my work more productive in Mac.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve learned some new skills, which should be my main concern, it&#8217;s ok. my horizon got bigger. And i put more focus on the way of accomplish something, from a higher view.</p></li>
<li><p>I started loving to sharing my knowledges &amp; skills with people, I gave two 「XXX for the newbies in TJPU」series presentation in my school. If I were a  the audience in my presentation, i&#8217;d be shocked:)</p></li>
<li><p>In the later this year, I started to purchase coffee bean and  make my coffee by hand then founded a start-up company called「Master Lee&#8217;s Food and Technology, LTD」. This company has it&#8217;s board , CEO, CTO and some other C*Os. I am the CEO, of course:) In the beginning, coffee&#8217;s our main product, but sooner our business expand to some another fields as well. The guys in this company are eager for our IPO :) Just this morning, the first day of the year, The CEO of this company making coffee for the employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Not having any big surprise in relationship, which i thought is a <strong>huge</strong> regret/failure in this year.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>2014 The Resolutions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Yeah, this comes more important than work, i think you know what it&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t want to write <strong>the last summary i wrote for 2013</strong> again.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep learning new stuffs, be passion about new stuffs and life, dare to break any kinds of limitations.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to make some real contributions to the <strong>Open Source Community</strong></p></li>
<li><p>I know I will make some new friends, hoping they like me as my friends did.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t know how much difficulties and pressure i&#8217;d got in my first official job, but to be honest, I don&#8217;t expect much of them:)</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;d move to HangZhou and live there for quite a long time, hoping i&#8217;d love to stay in that city.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaining some weight.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Thank you</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#8217;d like to my thank family and friends, they have faith in me and made me who i am today. I think i am doing pretty fine now. I am so so much thankful &amp; graceful for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though i don&#8217;t have a good scores on paper, i don&#8217;t looks like a great student in my university. But, you know. I am kinda awesome today:) LOL</p></li>
<li><p>That&#8217;s all, Let&#8217;s find out what this year has in store for me and I wish you a happy and lucky new year:)</p></li>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/11/24/how-i-got-my-first-official-full-time-job</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Preface</h3>

<ul>
<li>I got this offer a month ago and i am pretty satisfied about it.</li>
<li>This is a kinda long story about <strong>How I Got My First Official Full-Time Job</strong>, it&#8217;s been quite a journey and it just like riding a <strong>Roller-Coaster</strong>.</li>
<li>I was struggled with choosing which category of this story belongs and then it leads to another problem that which language i use to write this story.

<ul>
<li>This problem is solved. I put this post in my personal blog instead of my coding/tech blog. So i considered this is a life-related story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This story involves servals companies and some beautiful/smart/nice girls.</li>
<li>I am really really  thankful for the helps the <strong>HRs</strong> gave to me, I could still be desperately finding a job without their help.</li>
<li>I feel so lucky.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Let the Roller-Coaster begin.</h3>

<p>In the early September of this year, when i took off the plane to my university. I saw massive recruit advertisements posted by Alibaba INC.</p>

<ul>
<li>I started to wanted to work at Alibaba a year ago, because i like the way they do things.</li>
<li>Alibaba is one of the most active company in national/world-wide <strong>open-source</strong> community, which i really really look up to.</li>
<li>Alibaba is hell of a giant IT company in china. Alone with Baidu and Tencent.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was planed to finding a job in next year, just one or two months before graduation, because i still has some project i want to do in those semester.</p>

<p>Now, it looks like my plan needs to be changed. I don&#8217;t know they start recruiting people this early and i just ran into this message. So, i told my self you gotta take this opportunity, or you will be regret about this. then, i sent out my resume, and  i got their invitation to participate in their written exam in Tianjin.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s about a week before the exam begin. I am so so unconfident about my written exam, which is the first round of their recruitment. It&#8217;s so important to me. But I am that kind of guy which barely showed up in the class, instead writing codes in my room:) and always ended up with a little above 60&#8217; in the school exams.</p>

<ul>
<li>FYI, I don&#8217;t code that much right now, I spent more time with friends and having fun :)</li>
</ul>


<p>I prepared the written exam for a few days, noting special, just some basic data structure, algorithm and some basic knowledges. I thought that if i passed this exam, I will have a great shot of getting this offer. Because i know i have so much to show which they can not found in my resume or exam paper.</p>

<p>So I took this exam and i will get the result about wether i will get to the next round in one or two days later.</p>

<p>A day went by, a friend of mine, who also take part in this exam ask me if i got though the first round and he was already failed at second round. i began to worried because i still got no notice from the Alibaba. Somehow, I made a surprise decision which i don&#8217;t know why i wanna do that on that day. I asked my friend about the place he took the interview and i just went to there, to see if i can get any infos about my situation.</p>

<p>I washed my face and shaved a little bit, then just ran out to the hotel where they took interviews in the night. Luckily, there were not any guards in the door. I saw a beautiful HR wearing suit, dark skirt with high heels and dark nail polish walked into me. I still wonder why i still remember her outfit in that intense situation, i&#8217;d have felt nervous at that time :(</p>

<blockquote><p>HR: what are you doing here?</p>

<p>Me: I want to know if i passed the written exam.</p>

<p>He: We are still working on it, we will inform some students later.</p>

<p>Me: Since i am here already, can i just do the interview?</p>

<p>HR: what ? NOT! It&#8217;s already too late and interviewers were already left.</p>

<p>HR: So you just come here to interview?</p>

<p>Me: Oh, not. i already took the exam, but i was afraid i didn&#8217;t make it. I know some guys already took the interview today and I also know that i am much much better than them.</p>

<p>Me: Can you get my result now? just let me know if i still have any chances.. I started to worried.</p>

<p>HR: Ok, fine.. so you come with me, i will check your score upstairs.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, we went to the upstairs and just doing some meaningless chat while waking&#8230; blah..blah&#8230;blah
Then she came back and said.</p>

<blockquote><p>HR: okay, you <strong>almost fail</strong> the exam. now you can go back and wait for further notice, meanwhile, you can start to prepare your interview, like those projects, codes you mention in your resume&#8230;</p>

<p>ME: Thank you! thank you so so so much. But i don&#8217;t think i need to prepare my interview. I know what i got, it&#8217;s okay. thank you!!</p>

<p>ME: Are you sure i get to the interview? did you double-check that?</p>

<p>HR: Yeah, just go and wait for our calls&#8230;.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The day i start to loving Subway.</h3>

<p>in the next, i got a call from the hr and they want me to do the interview at 15:00 today at same hotel i visited last night.</p>

<ul>
<li>I put on a red shirt, that day, for a guru once tell me that red is my lucky color and i need to eat more meat and barbecue :)</li>
</ul>


<p>I got dressed and head out, it&#8217;s kinda early before the interview begin. so i went to a Subway nearby. It&#8217;s my first time that i really really enjoy the Sandwich there.
  * Now, I became a Subway fan, along with Burger King.</p>

<p>Then i went to the hotel to wait for my interview, i met some guys and we chat a little bit. I know i have the lowest score on paper and I am from a not that famous university. But, yeah. i don&#8217;t even feel any worried about that. I just know that I can beat them.</p>

<h5>First round of the interview(System Engineer)</h5>

<p>Finally, It&#8217;s my turn for the interview. i walked in and sit, my interviewer is a middle aged guy. But i can see that he is so serious about technical.</p>

<ul>
<li>After I finished the interview, i did a little on him, and it turned out that he has more than 10 years experiences and made a quite reputation in him field.</li>
</ul>


<p>I sit down, he started introduce himself and want me to introduce myself. I talked about my university experiences, some of the project of mine and why I am choosing Alibaba. There&#8217;re not that much questions and i think i&#8217;ve handle them pretty well.</p>

<p>Some of the questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li> what do i know about Open Source softwares.</li>
<li> The reason why i love C &amp; Linux so much</li>
<li> What do i want to do if i join Alibaba</li>
<li> What do i think this position(System Engineer)&#8217;s job</li>
<li> My views on math and developers.</li>
</ul>


<p>And we even talked about a project i working on:)</p>

<p>Them, i got a pretty surprising respond. He think the R&amp;D position might be more suitable for me. So, I was transfer to the R&amp;D interview.</p>

<h5>Second round of the interview(Research/Develop Engineer)</h5>

<p>So, I start my second round. As far as i know, this R&amp;D position is the most difficult position for me, because this position is the hottest position people want to get in and i will have to compete with a lot of students from Tianjin&#8217;s top universities.</p>

<ul>
<li>To those who don&#8217;t even know what they want, they applied to a R&amp;D position.</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s no way back. I even thought i will just get the offer if i stay in the System Engineer position. Because one of my big advantage is That I had pretty great Linux experiences/skills in the past years.</p>

<p>This interviewer is pretty young and smart. So i know i might have had a hard time for this one.</p>

<p>When i sit down and we greeted. then he start to asked questions. most questions I answered fine. But when the problems got deeper, i starter to freak out, because I really didn&#8217;t study something this deep, at this low level.</p>

<p>Since I put quite difference fields or skills in my resume, he almost check every single point of those fields. It turned out to be fine, for I wrote those entries honestly :)</p>

<p>Then, I pass this interview. March On!</p>

<h5>Third round of the interview(Research/Develop Engineer)</h5>

<p>This round is much easier than the pervious one. but that&#8217;s not the point of this round.</p>

<p>Before i start of this round of interview and was in the waiting room. Most people had been eliminated in the previous rounds, so the room is kind of empty. there&#8217;re only about ten students in the room, and some of us might get fired in the upcoming rounds.</p>

<p>A girl with New-Balance shoes came in, I gotta admit she was kinda beautiful, considering that she also had some skills. So instead of preparing for the next upcoming interviews, I was trying to find out any topic we can chat about:)  I don&#8217;t know how i start this chat, but it turn out to be a pretty good one.</p>

<blockquote><p>She: I had a few Linux experiences, and i am here for a System Engineer position.</p>

<p>Me: I just transfer from System Engineer to R&amp;D. So you gotta grab this one:)</p>

<p>She: Okay, i will try..</p></blockquote>

<p>No way!! This girl knows Linux and make it to this round, it looks like she really got something as well. I gotta ask for her number later, i told my self.</p>

<p>Then I saw that HR, the life-saver i met the other night. She saw me as well and i walked to her</p>

<blockquote><p>Me: Thanks to you, i can be here:)</p>

<p>She: I didn&#8217;t expect that, it looks like you really got something.</p>

<p>Me: HaHa, Sure:)</p></blockquote>

<p>A few minutes later, I got into the interview room again. This time, the interviewer looks kinda serious and unfriendly.</p>

<p>But it turned out i was wrong, we stared with a shell command, then he want me to implement those commands with servals programming languages i know and write it down in paper, then he just walked out.</p>

<p>The Python version is kinda easy, but the C version is just, it needs a lot of lines of codes to write every function then put them together. Finally, he know what i was doing and asked if i want to work in Hangzhou. I definitely said yes.</p>

<p>So, I passed this round as well. Went back to the waiting room.</p>

<h5>Fourth Round of the interview(HR)</h5>

<p>I got a great news that there&#8217;s no more technical upcoming interviews, what a relief!</p>

<p>That girl in New-Balance was still here waiting for her next round, so I gave her some tips about some Linux basic stuffs that the interviewer might ask.</p>

<p>That HR took a photo of me and the girl, that&#8217;s the only picture i got from this interview.</p>

<p>Then, I start my last interview and it&#8217;s around 7:00 pm.</p>

<p>This time, the interviewer is a mid-aged women who just 12 years older than me, she is very kind to me and I can see she was a pretty girl back in her youth.</p>

<p>We talked and laugh a lot, it didn&#8217;t like a interview at all. we talked about my failure relationship at university, how i got dumped by that girl i cared about, some crazy stuffs i did in those years and How i became the so-called leader of this so-called cloud computing group in university. also, how i feels about HangZhou&#8217;s foods and life there.</p>

<p>I said I love to accept any kind of challenge &amp; changes, which i do. including move to a whole new city and making new friends, meet new people.</p>

<p>She said i have so many interesting ideas, but I might be unstable. for i stopped school for a year, just because i found the life in university was boring. which i accepted that. i did break any kinds of rule for so so many times:)</p>

<p>Finally, She let me go and want me to wait for further notices.
At that time, i thought i got the offer for sure and i felt so excited.</p>

<h5>Later</h5>

<p>I went out of the hotel and it&#8217;s around 8:00. I forgot to say goodbye to the HR and that girl in New-Balance. But i know i will met them <strong>later</strong></p>

<p>So I planed to bring a little gift to that HR when i came back to sign the offer in a few days later.</p>

<h3>Its far from the finale</h3>

<p>I started to plan my future life in Hangzhou the other day, with quite a lot confident that i will get that offer soon. But, after a few days went by, i felt worried and terrible. then, I&#8217;ve been told that those HR staffs were already left Tianjin. So, I found out that i didn&#8217;t get the offer from Alibaba.</p>

<p>I summarized this experience of the Alibaba interview was just like riding in a roller coaster and it finally <strong>crashed</strong> But.. keep reading :)</p>

<p>It hurts me a lot. I stared to doubt myself for a few days. And then is national holiday but i really really didn&#8217;t in the mood of enjoy that holiday. It&#8217;s bad.</p>

<ul>
<li>A girl showed up, which makes me felt a little bit better:)</li>
</ul>


<p>I also read some articles in those days. read some stories about how those people get their first job and how their thought about that which i normally wouldn&#8217;t read at all. Most of people mentioned about luck, which makes me feel a little bit better. Maybe i was just need some luck, i thought. And i had to accept the fact that i was not that awesome as i thought i was. That is not the end of the world, i told myself.</p>

<p>Right now, since the offer of Alibaba is gone. I need to get a job from somewhere else. meanwhile, I started to learn and writing some stuffs. Hoping it could be helpful during this job hunting process.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I sent my resume to some companies and I did got some feedbacks. and they want me to have a interview.</p>

<p>So I went to beijing for a few days, to take those interviews, one by one.</p>

<ul>
<li>IBM</li>
<li>Opera</li>
<li>Ctrip</li>
<li>The surprising one</li>
<li>Baidu</li>
<li>Tencent</li>
</ul>


<h4>The blue giant - <strong>IBM</strong></h4>

<p>Since i can not have a Linux based job at Alibaba. the first company came to my mind is IBM. that company is making a huge contribution to the Open Source and play as a important role in Linux Community. Also it has a very great reputation in world wide IT industry.</p>

<p>Because of my bad education background, which those famous foreign company consider as a big factor, it took much longer before them approach me.</p>

<p>First, It was a phone interview, which i was doing fine, I guess. But i gotta admit, that was a really tough one. the interviewer asked a lot of questions about kernel, Operating System and C Language. none of them I can learn from university but all by myself. there is a english interview as well:) my accent is bad, but i told him that it wouldn&#8217;t be a problem, i just need some time to get used to that.</p>

<p>I got a feedback from a friend, he said i was doing ok especially for a student that comes from this second-class university and I made it to the second round. So i need to go to Beijing, IBM HQ of China.</p>

<ul>
<li> I also had subway that day before i took the interview.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those people in IBM are pretty skilled and most of them had a really great education background. Even taxi driver knows IBM in that district. You know, that taxi drivers in Beijing are barely know any places:(</p>

<p>My second round of interview in IBM began, I first took a English paper test, which i found is quite easy for me:)</p>

<p>Then, Two interviewer came in, that was the nightmare.</p>

<p>First, we talk about at a very low level how a kernel being boot up. which i&#8217;ve never dig up to.</p>

<p>Then, Their is some question about C and pointers. They want to to write the memory layouts in the blackboard, in bytes. Thanks to my pretty solid C foundation, i figured out those problems, but still, believe me, that&#8217;s hard!</p>

<p>Later, I just can not answer those question i don&#8217;t even remember now. I know I screwed up.</p>

<p>During this interview, i just feel like i was naked and those two evil interviewers don&#8217;t even like to talk to me. And they said i should have take the initiative during the interview and show them what i got, instead, i just let them to ask me those questions i don&#8217;t really good at.</p>

<p>After this interview was over. I got some feedback as well, they said i was doing pretty good in that interview, considering my university and my age. and want me to wait a few days for further notice.</p>

<h4>The big red browser - <strong>Opera</strong></h4>

<p>There is a python position opening form me and they want me to come over and doing a interview in Beijing, as well.</p>

<p>I was told that this interview will only took in less than one hour, and i had two interviewer.</p>

<p>We start with some python and networking basic. like some weird python syntax and usage, http, tcp ip. I answer they pretty great. Then i just describe python&#8217;s dict implement which i study for a while, after that i know i will definitely pass this one.</p>

<p>PS, The Opera&#8217;s office is awesome!</p>

<h4>The e-travel leading company - <strong>Ctrip</strong></h4>

<p>That opening is kind of like the one that ctrip offers, but it&#8217;s more related to Cloud Computing.</p>

<p>This one is quite this tough, because the interviewer thought i might have more experiences which i didn&#8217;t. So, this one didn&#8217;t end well.</p>

<h4>The surprising one - <strong>Sina</strong></h4>

<p>I sent my resume to a Sina&#8217;s HR and I explained why i couldn&#8217;t make to Tianjin to take their written exam in the late night around 1 am. Luckily enough, she is still online and forward my resume to a director. then, Right after i finished the Ctrip&#8217;s interview and ready to get some sleep, I got a call from that director and he ask me when can i come to Sina&#8217;s HQ to have a interview</p>

<p>Why Now?</p>

<p>So, i got dressed, jumped out of the bed and headed to Sina.</p>

<p>That director is kind of like my previous boss back in the days when i was a intern. So, i feel so good with him.</p>

<p>So, the interview begin. We talked about some of my skill and he start to find out that i really, really got something. then he asked me of what kind of books i&#8217;ve read during college days.</p>

<p>That was a funny moment, i said, okay, don&#8217;t laugh, my first one this a quite bad book, the green C programming book. HaHa</p>

<p>Then, i stop reading that crap.. I start to reading those famous technical books, like those:</p>

<ul>
<li>The C Programming Language, aka K&amp;R C</li>
<li>Computer System, A programmer&#8217;s Perspective</li>
<li>APUE, Advance Programming in UNIX environment</li>
<li>TCP/IP&#8230; blahblah</li>
</ul>


<p>Then, he ask me, why you didn&#8217;t read Richard Stevens&#8217;s UNIX Networking Programming, and i answered, yeah, i just found out this problem lately, it&#8217;s just because when i ready to read this book, i start to write python codes, and you know, python is networking is easy&#8230;</p>

<p>It just bad timing:( then we laugh again.</p>

<p>then he introduce his team to me, and how important his team is.</p>

<p>I can see he is pretty satisfied with me, then he said, if i can give you the offer right now, how much salary you want and i give him a range. then, he want me to wait a little while for the next round of the interview.</p>

<p>The second round of the interview just begin in a few minutes later, the interviewer is a quite old guy, the director&#8217;s boss. This time, we discussed some problem a little deeper, he was kind to me and he was also satisfied about my interview. i can feel that:)</p>

<p>Then, He want me to wait for another round, this round&#8217;s interviewer is a senior engineer. He came in and said he only wanted me to write some code in paper and want me to relax. he just want to check if i am really that good like those previous interviewer said.</p>

<p>I said ok, then i wrote some functions in C, as he required. the interesting part was just a few seconds later when i started writing codes, he asked me if i can keep talking with him while writing those codes, i said, ok, no problem. i just feel so confident at that time.</p>

<p>I finished those coding exam and we talk about some trick in C and Linux, that&#8217;s fun. Then he ask me if I can coding in lisp, I said, I might just can writing some simple Emacs configure files:)</p>

<p>Ok, this round is over and congrats to you:) he said.</p>

<p>After this round, the director came back, and tell me i was doing a pretty great job in those interviews and he&#8217;s certain that he will gave me the offer.</p>

<p>He said he could see that i had great enthusiasm about programming. and he could feel the passion inside me, that&#8217;s very rare. Now, it&#8217;s up to me to decide wether to take this offer or not.</p>

<p>Then, He continued,</p>

<blockquote><p>I know you will get some better offers in the future, the only thing
I can do <strong>right now</strong> is giving you the offer. Now, you have at least one offer from us. and you can go back and take a good rest.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow, that&#8217;s just so quick before i realized that i just got an offer, But i want to wait some times before making any decisions.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt so relaxed and took a nice dinner before i headed back to the hotel.</p>

<p>The director&#8217;s exact word about I will get some better offers, really really give me confident, which i&#8217;ve lost for some time and i felt like i was <strong>awesome</strong> again!</p>

<p>Also, I am really really thankful to that Sina&#8217;s HR, her got my resume in the midnight and arrange my interview as soon as she can. In that day, I just thought that she is the one that make my day <strong>lighter and brighter</strong></p>

<p>So, I went back to Tianjin the other day, started waiting for the messages from those companies.</p>

<h4>You think that&#8217;s the end of the story? No Way!</h4>

<p>On my way back, i got some interview invitation in a few weeks later from Baidu &amp; Tencent.</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not very sure about why i eventually skip those two interview:(</li>
</ul>


<p>Meanwhile, i start <strong>again</strong>, to looking for informations about that girl in New-Balance i met in Alibaba interview. luckily enough, i found a guy in her school and that guy had so much connections. then, bingo. i found that girl eventually and we talk a lot, like old friends. that&#8217;s great. But, she had a boyfriend, damn it!</p>

<p>I also trying to get in touch with that HR i met in Alibaba for that photo, and express my gratitude to her, even though I didn&#8217;t make it to the Alibaba. I almost search every weibo that were being sent in that places during that day. But I didn&#8217;t make any progress about that.</p>

<p>Then, I got messages from Opera and they want me to take the next round of interview, which, i decided not to go. For i didn&#8217;t think that offer is suitable for me.</p>

<p>IBM came later and they still want me to wait, i said ok.</p>

<p>The problem at that time was IBM or Sina.</p>

<h4>Sina is a pretty good one for me.</h4>

<p>I might be the first one who got the sina&#8217;s offer, because that day i took the interview in Beijing was the first day of Sina&#8217;s campus recruitment. That means while those students are taking their written exam, I&#8217;ve already got the offer:)</p>

<p>So, I know sina&#8217;s offer is pretty good and I almost decided to come over and sign the documents, then give over with this job hunting thing.</p>

<h4>The Roller-Coaster is keep going.</h4>

<p>Days later, I got a really really un-except call from <strong>Alibaba</strong> OMG!! I could felt my heart started to beat again! No kidding!</p>

<p>I wanted to figure out what is going on with my status. And They said that they did not actually declined me at the first place, Instead, they put me into a waiting list somehow. now, there&#8217;s a opportunity for me. OMG!!</p>

<p>During those days of waiting, I know that my offer in sina is a pretty good one, compare to those ones who also got the offer from Sina. Plus, the position is in one of the hottest team.</p>

<p>A few days of suffering on waiting, again, i here waiting! I got another call from Alibaba and they want me to sign the offer the next day.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that i didn&#8217;t get the offer from Alibaba at first place and the pretty good offer &amp; position in sina, I decide to go to Beijing and sign the damn offer with <strong>Alibaba @ Hangzhou</strong></p>

<p>That day i got up quite early, but time was so tight. Even I had that feeling that i might see the HR i met in Tianjin that day, but i just do not have any extra time to think about that:(</p>

<p>When i entered into that room, Oh, there she was:) I said hi, then there were so many stuffs I wanted to said to her, but, i don&#8217;t know which one to start. So, i just pick up one randomly and started chatting, blah..blah..blah</p>

<p>Later that day, I got the photo she took at Tianjin with me and that New-Balance girl via Laiwang.</p>

<p>So, thats how i got her Laiwang Account.</p>

<ul>
<li>Laiwang is a mobile IM APP, one of the Alibaba&#8217;s product.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think we are friends now, and just a few minutes ago, she told me that she wanted to read this blog:)</p>

<ul>
<li>So I gotta be careful with my words.</li>
</ul>


<h3>That&#8217;s how i got my first official full-time job</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s it. I got off the roller-coaster and continue my adventure, maybe that already started.</p>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>I know that&#8217;s not easy for me to get this first official full-time job, but, deep down in my heart, i wasn&#8217;t too worried about that.</p>

<p>After all, I know those <strong>AWESOME</strong> codes i wrote and somebody will eventually found out the value of those codes.</p>

<p>PS, Finding a perfect job is <strong>easier</strong> than got a girlfriend.</p>

<ul>
<li>You know what, when it comes to offer, i can still have choices!</li>
</ul>


<p>PSS, Writing this blog is <strong>harder</strong> than write codes.</p>

<p>PSSS, You should take a good rest now and look outside, it&#8217;s hard for you to read this long-piece-of-crap-and-boring blog.</p>

    <link href="http://sunus.me/blog/2013/11/12/my-first-world-wide-tech-conference/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-12T13:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/11/12/my-first-world-wide-tech-conference</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Since I&#8217;ve got so so much stuffs to be take care of lately.  so i didn&#8217;t post blog very often lately. But right now, I think everything is back to track now.  and i finally got some free times to do things i&#8217;ve always planned to do:) cheers!</p>

<p>I just get back from a Front-end conference called <a href="http://jingjs.org/">JingJS 2013</a> hosted in Beijing. That&#8217;s a world-wide conference that let&#8217;s some people that&#8217;s very great &amp; active at Front-end Open Source community to share there experiences and projects that they found interesting and encourage people like us to join them, to share.</p>

<p>So, I was chosen to be a guy named <a href="http://github.com/mde">Matthew Eernisse</a> &#8216;s buddy. My job mostly is to be his assistant. including communicate with the organizer and show him around the city.</p>

<p>When i was about to go to the airport to pick him up, I somehow met a girl Leslie who also had this assignment to pick up a speaker named <a href="http://github.com/alyraz">Alyssa Ravasio</a>, but then i just call her Jennifer Aniston. because i found she looks like Jennifer Aniston, in some way. so&#8230;  I will talk about it later.</p>

<p>Later on, Another speaker join us. He is <a href="http://github.com/oren">Oren Golan</a>. A handsome &amp; charming guy who don&#8217;t drink. yeah, he does NOT drink alcohol.</p>

<p>After me and Leslie got those three speaker off the plane, We decided to let them take the subway to the hotel. Because we thought they might want to feel what it&#8217;s like in young people&#8217;s daily life, taking subway go to work, etc.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty amazing. Matthew said. the subway is tooooo crowd. HAHAHAAHA.</p>

<p>Then we went out of the subway and can not grab a available taxi. Matthew felt amazed again:)</p>

<p>The next two days we went go the conference, met a lot of great guys from different countries.  That&#8217;s so mind-blowing event. The way that people loves Open Source is so beyond my imagination. A Chinese guy talked to Matthew about that his company develop a framework that likes Node a lot but using coroutine instead of callbacks. and is not  ready to open source yet. But Matthew just kept saying that you need to open source! again and agin.
that&#8217;s really funny.</p>

<p>Besides the conference, we had two different parties those days. one is a little more geeky and the other it more like a normal party. people drink, got drunk and plays beer ball  Ping Pong. Me and a guy call motherFORKER even win a round! pretty amazing!</p>

<p>Me and Matthew also talk about stuffs like what&#8217;s developer&#8217;s life like in China, the ways to think as a developer and what his thought about his company <a href="https://www.yammer.com/">yammer</a> being bought my Microsoft last year. Also, the GFW is a topic you can never avoid, especially when you talked with someone who just came to China:)</p>

<p>Finally, Here is some of the highlights of these two days.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Just picked up Oren at airport. Leslie made this name tag for me(Because mine is too ugly). It looks great!</p>

<p>  <img src="http://sunus.me/images/JingJS-4.jpg" alt="Photo1" /></p></li>
<li><p>Developers on a crowd subway</p>

<p>  <img src="http://sunus.me/images/JingJS-1.jpg" alt="Photo 2" /></p></li>
<li><p>Matthew kept saying Go Open Source</p>

<p>  <img src="http://sunus.me/images/JingJS-3.jpg" alt="Photo 3" /></p></li>
<li><p>Yay! That&#8217;s me and Developer Jennifer Anistor :)</p>

<p>  <img src="http://sunus.me/images/JingJS-2.jpg" alt="Photo 4" /></p></li>
</ul>


<p> I had a really really funny &amp; interesting days with all of you guys:):)
 Sorry, I forget to mention those Javascript &amp; Node stuffs :( they are less interesting!</p>

    <updated>2013-07-07T13:17:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/07/07/last-great-day-of-this-semester</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>yeah, this semester is finally over and i am setting in the subway&#8217;s waiting for my train back home. and right now the this place is playing one of my favorite song <em>you belong with me</em> by <em>Taylor Swift</em></p>

<p>Overall, this semester is kind nice. I tried a few new stuffs and i found that i liked them:)</p>

<p>In the beginning of this semester, i thought i might have some more time spend with that awesome girl, that girl who dumped but i still care about, etc. but it just didn&#8217;t happen, we just met a few time. but it still felt great, actually. can anyone give me one good reason to stop thinking of her:(</p>

<p>Also, i put some time on that team in school, it didn&#8217;t end up like i excepted before, but i didn&#8217;t want to talk about it that much, it just ok and i am really looking forward to continue this in next semester.</p>

<p>In the end of this semester, i met a few great people in Beijing. the first one is Xavier, we&#8217;ve been known for like a year, and look at him, he already start him second startup company and they looks promising. we talk about technic stuffs and what filed might have chance for us, etc. the incredible part is that he still remember how we met at first time, we both take the wrong subway and get off at wrong station. that&#8217;s fun. we will be partner, in the future, i think:)</p>

<p>And yesterday, that was a really nice day:) I might remember that day for a while. It just simply fun and nice. she was the receptionist girl at that time when i first met her, in the company where i got my first job interview. yeah, it about a year ago, i felt her was <strong>cute</strong> at that time, but actually, we didn&#8217;t talk much.</p>

<p>Yesterday, i finally got a chance to met her and not doing any kinds of interviews, instead we played billiards and had dinner together:) I lost the billiards game to her, but i didn&#8217;t feel ashamed at all, LOL. then we went to a barbecue restaurant that i like a lot. it was a nice place with fun shows to watch. and I gave out my first <strong>on stage</strong> dance in that place:( which, right not i still can not believe that i actually did those things.</p>

<p>She is still cute, besides i felt like we have a lot in common so that we didn&#8217;t end up like running out of topics to talk about, which i was kinda afraid before we met. also, her personality is good, just like i excepted.</p>

<p>She said she had a good time that night, more that once. which I am not sure if she really mean it or not:) but anyway, it&#8217;s always good to here stuffs like this.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how she think of me, but i think we will met again, then, i will win the billiard game, at least:)</p>

<p>Also there&#8217;re some funny parts i think i should also mention in here.</p>

<ol>
<li>I lost the billiards game, i did make some brilliant shots. but somehow, i just lose.</li>
<li>When we got to the restaurant, we had to siting right next to each other, on the one side of the table. but i like setting in front of people, i thought that&#8217;s more comfortable. we both sitting in the one side of that table just looks like much more intimate. The reason we do this is because that table has a really  good view of the show, which made it less awkward.</li>
<li>luckily, i think she liked the show.</li>
<li>when we about to got back, in the bus station.

<ul>
<li>she said <strong>are you sure you can find your way back to the hotel? should i take you to there?</strong></li>
<li>i replied <strong>i think i can, besides, my hotel&#8217;s traffic is not that good&#8230; </strong></li>
<li>then, she yelled at me <strong>who says i want to take you to the hotel? i just want to take you to a subway station, blahblah&#8230;</strong></li>
<li>OK, that was awkward enough. haha ;(</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s probably how i end this semester, the summer vacation is starting from right now, let&#8217;s enjoy it yay :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>It&#8217;s been a while</h3>

<p>yeah, it&#8217;s been a while since i got back from holiday. and i got so much work to do lately, personal and school stuffs.</p>

<p>first of all, i confirmed with my teacher that the team we have now, needs new guys and needs them badly. the members we have now are great, but they have their own stuffs to care take of and i have no right to ask them to do anything, so i totally understand them.</p>

<p>second, about the goal out group needs to accomplished, it&#8217;s kinda big and hard. so, i hope the new guys grow more quick:) who knows. they are young, motivated, that&#8217;s good. i think.</p>

<p>I think i am about to give a <strong>public presentation</strong> in a few days later, in school. so, there&#8217;s a great chance to let people to know me better. also, there might be another chance of meeting the right person. so, i need to get it prepared well. and i think i do. and that&#8217;s kinda funny.</p>

<p>I do a few so-called-interview today. that&#8217;s another funny story:)</p>

<p>I met a really great girl last week, yeah, she is really great but i don&#8217;t think we will end up well. she is too great for me. i got her number which i won&#8217;t call in the near future.</p>

<p>that last thing is, i met vivian tonight again. which i don&#8217;t have a clue what we will talk about. so i just give her a stuffs i brought from holiday. again, i didn&#8217;t think i will give it to her, because i decided not to talk to her long time ago.  but, it just happened.</p>

<p>I just can not move on. that&#8217;s sad:( but i will just keep trying.</p>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/05/17/great-article-about-troublshooting-a-server-in-first-five-minutes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>I didn&#8217;t write this, i found the post a few days ago and i think it can be very helpful, so i make a copy here.</h2>

<h3><a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">Original Link Here</a></h3>

<h1>First 5 Minutes Troubleshooting A Server</h1>

<p>Back when our team was dealing with operations, optimization and scalability at <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">our previous company</a>, we had our fair share of troubleshooting poorly performing applications and infrastructures of various sizes, often large (think CNN or the World Bank). Tight deadlines, “exotic” technical stacks and lack of information usually made for memorable experiences.</p>

<p>The cause of the issues was rarely obvious: here are a few things we usually got started with.</p>

<h3>Get some context</h3>

<p>Don’t rush on the servers just yet, you need to figure out how much is already known about the server and the specifics of the issues. You don’t want to waste your time (trouble) shooting in the dark.</p>

<p>A few “must have”:</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly are the symptoms of the issue? Unresponsiveness? Errors?</li>
<li>When did the problem start being noticed?</li>
<li>Is it reproducible?</li>
<li>Any pattern (e.g. happens every hour)?</li>
<li>What were the latest changes on the platform (code, servers, stack)?</li>
<li>Does it affect a specific user segment (logged in, logged out, geographically located…)?</li>
<li>Is there any documentation for the architecture (physical and logical)?</li>
<li><strong>Is there a monitoring platform?</strong> Munin, Zabbix, Nagios, <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>… Anything will do.</li>
<li><strong>Any (centralized) logs?</strong>. Loggly, Airbrake, Graylog…</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two ones are the most convenient sources of information, but don’t expect too much: they’re also the ones usually painfully absent. Tough luck, make a note to get this corrected and move on.</p>

<h3>Who’s there?</h3>

<pre><code>$ w
$ last
</code></pre>

<p>Not critical, but you’d rather not be troubleshooting a platform others are playing with. One cook in the kitchen is enough.</p>

<h3>What was previously done?</h3>

<pre><code>$ history
</code></pre>

<p>Always a good thing to look at; combined with the knowledge of who was on the box earlier on. Be responsible by all means, being admin shouldn’t allow you to break ones privacy.</p>

<p>A quick mental note for later, you may want to update the environment variable <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> to keep track of the time those commands were ran. Nothing is more frustrating than investigating an outdated list of commands…</p>

<h3>What is running?</h3>

<pre><code>$ pstree -a
$ ps aux
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>ps aux</code> tends to be pretty verbose, <code>pstree -a</code> gives you a nice condensed view of what is running and who called what.</p>

<h3>Listening services</h3>

<pre><code>$ netstat -ntlp
$ netstat -nulp
$ netstat -nxlp
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to prefer running them separately, mainly because I don’t like looking at all the services at the same time. <code>netstat -nalp</code> will do to though. Even then, I’d ommit the <code>numeric</code> option (IPs are more readable IMHO).</p>

<p>Identify the running services and whether they’re expected to be running or not. Look for the various listening ports. You can always match the PID of the process with the output of <code>ps aux</code>; this can be quite useful especially when you end up with 2 or 3 Java or Erlang processes running concurrently.</p>

<p>We usual prefer to have more or less specialized boxes, with a low number of services running on each one of them. If you see 3 dozens of listening ports you probably should make a mental note of investigating this further and see what can be cleaned up or reorganized.</p>

<h3>CPU and RAM</h3>

<pre><code>$ free -m
$ uptime
$ top
$ htop
</code></pre>

<p>This should answer a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any free RAM? Is it swapping?</li>
<li>Is there still some CPU left? How many CPU cores are available on the server? Is one of them overloaded?</li>
<li>What is causing the most load on the box? What is the load average?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hardware</h3>

<pre><code>$ lspci
$ dmidecode
$ ethtool
</code></pre>

<p>There are still a lot of bare-metal servers out there, this should help with;</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying the RAID card (with BBU?), the CPU, the available memory slots. This may give you some hints on potential issues and/or performance improvements.</li>
<li>Is your NIC properly set? Are you running in half-duplex? In 10MBps? Any TX/RX errors?</li>
</ul>


<h3>IO Performances</h3>

<pre><code>$ iostat -kx 2
$ vmstat 2 10
$ mpstat 2 10
$ dstat --top-io --top-bio
</code></pre>

<p>Very useful commands to analyze the overall performances of your backend;</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking the disk usage: has the box a filesystem/disk with 100% disk usage?</li>
<li>Is the swap currently in use (si/so)?</li>
<li>What is using the CPU: system? User? Stolen (VM)?</li>
<li><code>dstat</code> is my all-time favorite. What is using the IO? Is MySQL sucking up the resources? Is it your PHP processes?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mount points and filesystems</h3>

<pre><code>$ mount
$ cat /etc/fstab
$ vgs
$ pvs
$ lvs
$ df -h
$ lsof %2BD / /* beware not to kill your box */
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>How many filesystems are mounted?</li>
<li>Is there a dedicated filesystem for some of the services? (MySQL by any chance..?)</li>
<li>What are the filesystem mount options: noatime? default? Have some filesystem been re-mounted as read-only?</li>
<li>Do you have any disk space left?</li>
<li>Is there any big (deleted) files that haven’t been flushed yet?</li>
<li>Do you have room to extend a partition if disk space is an issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Kernel, interrupts and network usage</h3>

<pre><code>$ sysctl -a | grep ...
$ cat /proc/interrupts
$ cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack /* may take some time on busy servers */
$ netstat
$ ss -s
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Are your IRQ properly balanced across the CPU? Or is one of the core overloaded because of network interrupts, raid card, …?</li>
<li>How much is swappinness set to? 60 is good enough for workstations, but when it come to servers this is generally a bad idea: you do not want your server to swap… ever. Otherwise your swapping process will be locked while data is read/written to the disk.</li>
<li>Is <code>conntrack_max</code> set to a high enough number to handle your traffic?</li>
<li>How long do you maintain TCP connections in the various states (<code>TIME_WAIT</code>, …)?</li>
<li><code>netstat</code> can be a bit slow to display all the existing connections, you may want to use <code>ss</code> instead to get a summary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.lognormal.com/blog/2012/09/27/linux-tcpip-tuning/">Linux TCP tuning</a> for some more pointer as to how to tune your network stack.</p>

<h3>System logs and kernel messages</h3>

<pre><code>$ dmesg
$ less /var/log/messages
$ less /var/log/secure
$ less /var/log/auth
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Look for any error or warning messages; is it spitting issues about the number of connections in your conntrack being too high?</li>
<li>Do you see any hardware error, or filesystem error?</li>
<li>Can you correlate the time from those events with the information provided beforehand?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cronjobs</h3>

<pre><code>$ ls /etc/cron* %2B cat
$ for user in $(cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:); do crontab -l -u $user; done
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Is there any cron job that is running too often?</li>
<li>Is there some user’s cron that is “hidden” to the common eyes?</li>
<li>Was there a backup of some sort running at the time of the issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Application logs</h3>

<p>There is a lot to analyze here, but it’s unlikely you’ll have time to be exhaustive at first. Focus on the obvious ones, for example in the case of a LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apache &amp; Nginx</strong>; chase down access and error logs, look for <code>5xx</code> errors, look for possible <code>limit_zone</code> errors.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong>; look for errors in the <code>mysql.log</code>, trace of corrupted tables, innodb repair process in progress. Looks for slow logs and define if there is disk/index/query issues.</li>
<li><strong>PHP-FPM</strong>; if you have php-slow logs on, dig in and try to find errors (php, mysql, memcache, …). If not, set it on.</li>
<li><strong>Varnish</strong>; in <code>varnishlog</code> and <code>varnishstat</code>, check your hit/miss ratio. Are you missing some rules in your config that let end-users hit your backend instead?</li>
<li><strong>HA-Proxy</strong>; what is your backend status? Are your health-checks successful? Do you hit your max queue size on the frontend or your backends?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After these first 5 minutes (give or take 10 minutes) you should have a better understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is running.</li>
<li>Whether the issue seems to be related to IO/hardware/networking or configuration (bad code, kernel tuning, …).</li>
<li>Whether there’s a pattern you recognize: for example a bad use of the DB indexes, or too many apache workers.</li>
</ul>


<p>You may even have found the actual root cause. If not, you should be in a good place to start digging further, with the knowledge that you’ve covered the obvious.</p>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/05/15/port-mapping-slash-forwarding-with-iptables-in-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>We got a problem with the networking in my dorm and laboratory, if outgoing traffic port is 3389, the connection will be banned. so, we need to figure a way out to connect a Windows server&#8217;s 3389 port, which is suck, i mean, Windows sucks.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>I connected to one of the linux server which is in the same lan with Suck Windows Server with port, let&#8217;s say 63389. the the linux with redirect the connection from 63389 to Suck Windows Server&#8217;s port 3389.</p>

<p>this is what i did in the linux server:</p>

<pre><code>    iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING 1 -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 63389 -j DNAT --to-destination SUCK-WIN-IP:3389
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 3389 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>the second target <strong> MASQUERADE </strong> is a really handy thing, it will be acting like SNAT most times, but it can also auto-adjust some connection problems with extra <strong>COST</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Summary for the past</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>the &#8220;thing&#8221; i do in school, still making very slow progress, some of the guys starting contribute to the group, i am glad to see that.</p></li>
<li><p>i made a small web app called find-the-one for guokr group&#8217;s searching. it works fine, i learn some new technic and it might be helpful in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li>the very first redone of i made that is because I was trying to find if there&#8217;s any girl i might found interesting in tianjin. so i wrote that app, it seems that my hope <strong>didn&#8217;t come true.</strong></li>
<li>but, there is quite amount of people like that app and using it. so, i am glad i can make another stuff people like.</li>
<li>that app is in the Guokr.com&#8217;s homepage :) it got about 1000pv in it&#8217;s first day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h1>Some other stuff</h1>

<p>  basically, i write this just want to say， i am trying so hard to moving on, and i think somehow, it might work :)</p>

<p>  And there&#8217;s another interesting story, there&#8217;s a front desk girl i ‘kinda’ like from the company that gave me the very first job offer but i didn&#8217;t accept in the end. she saw my WeiBo about IronMan3, and we talk about the comment &#8216;haha hahaha hahahaha&#8217; i gave to that movie, i went great and i found her interesting too, and she like&#8217;s billiard too. so, I might have chance to see her again, but not interview involved this time! good luck.</p>

<p>  One last thing, i am gonna to re-watch the An <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1866479/" title="The Avengers">The Avengers</a> again, since i just finished the IronMan 3 a few days ago.</p>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/04/21/i-dont-like-this-busy-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>hi, it&#8217;s been a while:) i just had some busy weeks and finally, i think i can take a break now. i can spend more time with friends and my personal work, plus some go on dates, if i am <strong>luckily</strong> enough.</p>

<p>i had been playing multiply roles for some weeks.</p>

<h3>System Administrator</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since the data on our servers got destroyed by mistake, i have to do that form scratch and got some new problems, mostly because we now work at a new lab with different networking enviroment.  it took some extra work. and also i have to re-write and setup our team wiki pages. i think that wiki is important but some of the guys in the team didn&#8217;t think that way, fine. now i can say that with confident that i am fully qualified for a <strong>SA</strong> position:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>HR guy</h3>

<ul>
<li>All right, it&#8217;s not that <strong>official</strong>, but i do have some rights at this team right now, and i did have received some resumes and <strong>hire</strong> someone to do stuffs with us, LOL. hoping i hired the right guy. and i am still want people to work with us, see the recruiting ad here:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf" title="download os-recuriting.pdf">PDF version: http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo">HTML version: http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>i am waiting, join us soon:)</li>
</ul>


<h3><em>Talker</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what the fuck the <em>talker</em> is ? but i can explain what that is, i talked with some of the main members our this team, asked their thougths on this <strong>thing</strong> we are doing right now, what&#8217;re they thinking and what they want to do next. and their answer is just, let&#8217;s say, simple.</li>
<li>I used to have pretty high admire on them, and i used to think i can count on them. but right now, i think i have to re-consider those thoughts. obviously they have other pressing matters right now, i have no comment on this and i have no right to judge them. but, i have mine too, and it&#8217;s the main reason why i came back this year. it&#8217;s definitely <strong>NOT</strong> what we do right now. if you don&#8217;t have motivation or this s not interested to you any more, you can quit. because at this point, i just find out every one right now are replaceable, i can not see the quality/ability we need in you right now, but, i once think you have those.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Secretary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes, secretary. I wrote a lot those days and i knew what i know my writing skills sucks. glad i have some guy to help me. final, i finished those crap, I can not believe some parts of those paper are written by me.</li>
<li>besides writing papers, I went around, hand in papers to different people, get their signature. even printed the paper.</li>
<li>A teacher call me everyday around 9 am to wake up and go to he office, to write.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Team Leader</h3>

<ul>
<li>i don&#8217;t like this title, but i did have those title in some document files. since i talked to the guys in the team, i have to think and assigned tasks about we need to do at this point and future as well to them, based on their skills, attitute and motivation. i think i am doing ok, hoping they will do the same:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Developer</h3>

<ul>
<li>yeah, that&#8217;s what i love most, luckily i found i need some simple but basic feature/service but it didn&#8217;t exist. so i write a script to get it done and i am using it on a daily basis. of course i open source of this project at <strong><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">github The Backup-Box</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">The Backup-Box </a> it can sync/backup you files using the services provided by stuffs like dropbox, google drive, amazon cloud but offers a feature that allowed you to select any files on your machine and get it backed up, <strong>you don&#8217;t have to manually put those files into the directory in the cloud drive</strong></li>
<li>yesterday i found the first version code of hub looks ugly and seems confuse, so i rewrite most of them, it now looks much like my code:)</li>
<li>i start to take license seriously, so i chose <em>MIT Open Source License</em> to publish bub.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Student</h3>

<ul>
<li>i went to a Linux class in school, but i ran off in less than ten minutes.because i don&#8217;t find any nice girl in the classroom.</li>
<li>kidding, i got other stuff to take care of at that time.</li>
<li>kidding, again. if there is nice girl in the classroom, that &#8216;other stuff&#8217; can certainly wait another hour:)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Some other stuffs</h2>

<ul>
<li>i am glad i still stay in the campus and did&#8217;t want to <strong>quit</strong> again. this is a quit week and i don&#8217;t really enjoy this kind of busy, it&#8217;s not what i want. i just want to do <strong>my thing</strong> and get it done perfectly.</li>
<li>i don&#8217;t even got time to swim, but i got time to swim and writing blog today, it feels great. i am making progress in the pool.</li>
<li>i watched a great movie called <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/"><em>waiting alone</em> (<strong>http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/</strong>)</a> , i found it just like a mirror to me and i just found my <strong>Liu Rong</strong> in my life, or maybe i knew it for quite a while but afraid to admit it? god, i wish i can watch this movie earlier.</li>
<li>i will watch another great movie <em>Django Unchained</em> this week. i should watch it earlier but just too busy this week, now that i got time, i will watch it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Something is missing ?</h2>

<p>nope:)
good night and wish me luck.</p>

<p>因为ungetc的原因，代码请用gcc编译vc/vs对ungetc的处理不很好。</p>

<p>fo2_bug就是2b的字符串反转函数,把字符串ins反转之后存到outs.在main调用fo2_bug之后。会有点异想不到的事情花生～～</p>

<p>有同学说说fo2_bug这个函数的bug在哪儿，bug的症状是啥，为什么会出现bug&#8230;怎么fix就随便吧，太轻松了～</p>

<p>答对的女同学我请吃饭吧..</p>

<p>男同学，嗯。。送一个月高速PROXY或者迅雷会员吧&#8230;.<sup>^</sup></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>hi, there.
yeah, i am gonna turn 0x17 tomorrow, that&#8217;s another whole new year for me and i think i just end my time in 0x16.
after reading my last year&#8217;s post, the theme of my 0x16 is &#8216;trying hard to be a guy that deserves you&#8217; , i think i failed, but i will continue to do so in my upcoming 0x17 times :)</p>

<p><strong>I failed to win her heart :&lt;</strong></p>

<p>but anyway, my 0x16 times turned out to be good. i got a nice job in the early year, i learned a lot from those awesome guys i met in the dev team and i gained a lot, i wish to be as good as them in the beginning. but in the end, i got acknowledged by them. it&#8217;s not easy, but it&#8217;s quite a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong>I really enjoyed thoses times in beijing, writing codes and getting paid and having tons of fun with new friends</strong></p>

<p>then, i quit that job and got back to school, plan to having some normal college student&#8217;s life. that&#8217;s, mostly a serious relationship with someone i like.</p>

<p><strong>I need some motivation to be excellent againn</strong></p>

<p>Also, this year, the main reason of me quitting the job and getting back to schol is, i really really want some <em>changes</em>, though i don&#8217;t know what that is, but it will come eventually, right?</p>

<p><strong>I already made some of those, namely from user-friendly linux distribution to a more flexible one, from linux to OS X, from vim to emacs, etc</strong></p>

<p>I think this year will be awesome, and i&#8217;d love to take all the challenges and opportunity in the upcoming days.</p>

<p><strong>i will do more sports!</strong></p>

<p><strong>happy birthday and good luck for whatever that is.</strong></p>

<p>END OF 0x16.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/sunuslee/5179422">https://gist.github.com/sunuslee/5179422</a></li>
<li>you probobly need to modify this file a little bit, or just create your own with <code>iptables-save &gt; filename</code></li>
<li>make sure you have <strong>PPP0-IP</strong> in that file. because this script will replace <strong>PPP0-IP</strong> with the real <strong>PPP0-IP</strong> address.</li>
<li>you need to put the file working-iptables-rules along with setroute.sh, in the same directory.</li>
<li>if you are interested, those lines contain |sunus-a/b/c/d| are the Log, demonstration of how the packets went through all the way from one end to another.</li>
<li>this may have <strong>bugs</strong>, most likely.</li>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>First of all, it all because my MacBookPro&#8217;s xl2tp utils can not work under my school&#8217;s networking enviroment. so this is how the post is born.</p>

<p>I have been digging with those stuffs for almost a week, and now, finally i get it rolling and it seems awesome. this post will talks about netfilter known as iptables and ip route policy. and some technic/tool like tcpdump will be involved as well.</p>

<h1>Environment</h1>

<p>The environment i have is like this below:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------    -----------------
| Slow          |    | Fast          |
| Internet-1    |    | Internet-2    |
| 10.10.149.1   |    | 123.150.232.1 |
-----------------    -----------------
         |             |
[eth0.2] |             |[ppp0]
         |             |
        --------------------------
        | Route, Running Linux   |
        | br-lan: 192.168.1.1    | [br-lan]      ------------------------
        | ppp0:   123.150.232.74 | --------------| Other Machines in Lan|
        | eth0.2: 10.10.149.4    |               ------------------------
        --------------------------
        |                        |
[br-lan]|                        |[br-lan]
        |                        |
        |                        |
        |                        |
  -------------------------      ----------------------
  |ArchLinux              |      | MacBook            |
  |eth0: 192.168.1.245    |      | en0:192.168.1.169  |
  |ppp0: 180.134.135.173  |      |                    |
  -------------------------      ----------------------
        |
        |
        |
        |
  ------------------
  | Fast           |
  | Internet-3     |
  | 180.134.135.1  |
  ------------------
</code></pre>

<p>   after connect the wires. there is three <strong> physic wires </strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong>Slow Internet-1 </strong>this is the only one that connects to outside my dorm. via route&#8217;s port WAN.</li>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong> ArchLinux </strong> this one is in a Route&#8217;s port #1 LAN</li>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong> MacBook </strong> same as above, using Route&#8217;s port #2 LAN</li>
</ul>


<p>  There is also something to be noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <strong>ppp0</strong> in <strong>Route</strong> is a high-speed connection(VPN). it needs to go though <strong>eth0.2</strong> to connect the VPN-server, then it will generate a Virtual Network InterFace, that is, ppp0.</p></li>
<li><p>the another <strong>ppp0</strong> in <strong>ArchLinux</strong> is also the high-speed connection. but firstly, it goes to <strong>Route</strong>, then the VPN-server.</p></li>
<li><p>in this environment, you can consider those ppp0 as real NICs that are connected to the internet as well.</p></li>
<li><p>So, we can say eth0.2 and two ppp0 are all outgoing Interfaces.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Solutions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>   I repeat what i want to accomplished here:</p>

<p>   1 .    i want my MacBook can connected to the internet.</p>

<p>   2 .    i want my MacBook&#8217;s internet connection to be as <strong>FAST</strong> as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>   Before we get started, there&#8217;s something we can do and can&#8217;t do, in general.</p>

<p>   1 .    Seting the <strong>default route</strong> to 180.134.135.1 for ArchLinux and a route to lan. We do this because we want all the trafftic goes to a fast internet connecting while we keep the connection to the other machines in the lan still work.</p>

<pre><code># route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
# route add default gw 180.134.135.1 dev ppp0
</code></pre>

<p>   2 .    Because there is other machines in the lan, so we can not set 123.150.232.1 as <strong>default route</strong> for Route, just like the ArchLinux. there is only <strong> me </strong> can access the Fast Internet-2.( The <strong>Benefit</strong> of being me or with me :) lol! )</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The Slow Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   Making the MacBook can connect to the internet, but it just too slow for me. Just set up machines and route like the diagram above, it will result this:</p>

<p>   1 .  the ArchLinux using Internet-3.</p>

<p>   2 .  the MacBookPro using Slow-Internet-1</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The A Little Bit Faster Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   Making the MacBook Using ArchLinux&#8217;s Internet-3 and the ArchLinux still keep unchanged in Slow Solution. This solution requires those steps.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>  in the MacBook, change default route from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.245</p>

<p> In MacBook:
 # route add default 192.168.1.245
 # route del default 192.168.1.1</p></li>
<li><p>  in ArchLinux, set up a route policy/rule</p>

<ul>
<li><p>  the packets that comes from MacBook(192.168.1.169), Using the gateway of Internet-3.</p>

<pre><code>In ArchLinux:
# add a empty table to route table
echo '7375 SunusRules' &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
# add a default route rule to newly create table SunusRules
ip route add default via 180.134.135.173 dev ppp0 table SunusRules
# add this table to routing rules, all the packet comes from MacBook, apply this route rule.
ip rule add from 192.168.1.169 table SunusRules
</code></pre></li>
<li><p> We are done here.</p></li>
<li><p> In fact, i don&#8217;t think add a route rule here is necessarily, but anyway, it&#8217;s a good time to get the first impression of what this can do. which we will make the best use of it in next Solution.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Ultimate And More Fast Solution, so far</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   As you may think, why we still didn&#8217;t use Fast-Internet-2 yet. Now, it&#8217;s time to rolling on this connection! Let the MacBook and only MacBook use this connection.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> In fact, this is a kinda complicated process, we need to do the following stuffs to put it all together to work properly.</p>

<p> 1 . Leave MacBook&#8217;s default (192.168.1.1) untouched.</p>

<p> 2 . Let the Route know, if a packet is come from MacBook(192.168.1.169), sets the <strong>Gateway</strong> of this connection to 1123.150.232.1 and <strong>Outgoing Interface</strong> to ppp0. because at this point, only ppp0 can connect to it&#8217;s <strong>Gateway</strong>(123.150.232.1)</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>policy routing</strong> is the first magic.

<ul>
<li>as most of us might already knew that, the linux kernel only allow exactly one <strong>efficient default</strong> in <strong>route table</strong>.</li>
<li>so this needs is beyond a simple <code>route</code> command can do. but, don&#8217;t worry. net-tools is out of date for so long, let us introduce the new <code>ip</code> tools to do this for us.</li>
<li>basically, this is still maintain that one kernel default route in route table, but, it allow us to add custom route table based on our needs, and set up the right condition. e.g <strong>the packet&#8217;s source address/net</strong> or <strong>the incoming interface</strong>, etc see <code>ip route help</code>.

<ul>
<li><p>the steps to make this happened are:</p>

<pre><code># add a table id and table name to the route table database, just make sure they are unique.
echo '7375 sunusroute' &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
# check if that succeeded, the out should be empty.
ip route show table sunusroute
# then, add route rules to this newly create table.
# set the default route/gateway of this table
ip route add default via 123.150.232.1 dev ppp0
# finally, add a rule to tell the kernel, under what circumstance,
the packet should use the route table from what we just set,
instead of the default route rules. we just set this simple rule, if a packet is from 192.168.1.169, then apply the rules in route table sunusroute.
ip rule add from 192.168.1.169 table sunusroute
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>check if those are valid by:</p>

<pre><code>ip rule show
&gt;&gt; 0: from all lookup local
&gt;&gt; 32761: from 192.168.1.169 lookup sunusroute
&gt;&gt; many-more-lines-of-other-rules
ip route show table sunusroute
&gt;&gt; default via 123.150.108.1 dev ppp0
ip route flush cache
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the last command <code>ip route flush cache</code> is just a precaution, in case the old rules in cache might do something nasty.</p></li>
<li><p>we are done in this step.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> 3 . Also, Since the Route&#8217;s default gateway isn&#8217;t 123.150.232.1, so it&#8217;s a must to set packet&#8217;s <strong>source address</strong> to 123.150.232.74. so here we will do a <strong>SNAT</strong> magic.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we are officially meet the iptables here, the firewall of the linux, a great tool for many other usages as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>the iptables consists by some tables, and those tables has some chains. the packet need to go all the way from the very first chain to the very last one. so that this packet can be send/receive correctly. during the packet&#8217;s travel in those tables and chains, it might be modify, accept, drop or reject, we can even add marks to those packets so that we can debug them.</li>
<li>here is a brief image of how a packets goes.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://sunus.me/images/iptables_traverse.jpg" title="iptables_traverse" alt="iptables packetes traversal path" /></p>

<ul>
<li>obviously, what we want the route to do is:</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>forward the packets from 192.168.1.169 to interface ppp0 with the right gateway 123.150.231.1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>follow the diagram, the packets should go through the tables and chains in the order of</p>

<ol>
<li>[packet come in from ppp0]</li>
<li>[raw-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[mangle-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[filter-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[ROUTING-DESICION]</li>
<li>[mangle-FORWARD]</li>
<li>[filter-FORWARD]</li>
<li>[ROUTING-DESICION]</li>
<li>[mangle-POSTROUTING]</li>
<li>[nat-POSTROUTING]</li>
<li>[packet come out from ppp0]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>I once not sure/doubt about what those <strong>ROUTING-DESICION</strong> do, after my research, i think it&#8217;s just decide what <strong>route</strong> to use, basically, it just look up the routing table and get a <strong>route</strong> to use.</p></li>
<li><p>so, what we need to do is, change the packets&#8217;s source address right after the packet go off. that is, in the step ten.</p>

<p> <code>iptables -t nat -o ppp0 -j SNAT --to-address 123.150.232.74</code></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> 4 . We&#8217;re pretty much done here:)</p>

<p> 5 . Enjoy!</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong> Long time no see </strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hi, there! First of all, happy new year to you and wish you all have a wonderful new year, i give you my very best wishes here:)
Yeah, i did quit my job last year and had theses about 40 days of <strong>AWESOME</strong> holidays in my hometown with my family and friends which is fun and happy. We went to couple of places with views, of course, i took some photos, too. But most of those photos are mountains and some kind of <strong>vulgar</strong> pictures. LOL</p></li>
<li><p>Besides of having fun, i got my MacBook, it&#8217;s a whole new user experiences, which i can not tell it&#8217;s better that Linux or not. but compare to Windows. it&#8217;s definitely a piece of work. Windows sucks, i said it to all the people i care about! :) I am getting used to OS X and i think it&#8217;s more comfortable to develop some <strong>app</strong> on that machine than my old laptop. But it&#8217;s okay, i do Linux-related/python work on my old machine while i am also a newcomer of APP developing. i am getting my motivations back, it just feel much better that i want to and CAN code again!</p></li>
<li><p>Tomorrow i will fly back to school and i don&#8217;t know what that is, i am leading some students to launch a <strong>OpenStack</strong> project in school, even though i don&#8217;t think that will be too much difficult for me, given the current situation we have. but still, i will do the most major work. don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s good for me or not, just wait and see how it goes. Also, i want some nice <strong>girls</strong> who&#8217;s interested in front-end to help me, i don&#8217;t know if she exists in my school.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the same-old-boring topic, i can not stop thinking about her, i know she also had a great great time on holiday, she sure did! so, let&#8217;s just hope she is still available. I even pray for that in a old temple. kidding! i didn&#8217;t do that:) so, still, chances are slim but i still don&#8217;t want to give up on this girl who had stolen my heart for months, in some point stolen my codes as well:&lt; hoping i can make this right. We didn&#8217;t send a word to each other in this whole holiday and i am not sure if she still remember me or not. but, i had hard time picking gifts for her and lucky(or not?) enough, i got something gift picking advice from my friends and sisters. so, just wait and see if she like that or not.</p></li>
<li><p>I am Back and I miss you all! the new semester could be a interesting one, not because of the school or class but you and all the uncertain changes and opportunity i wanted for a while!!</p></li>
