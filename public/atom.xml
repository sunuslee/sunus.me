    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>yeah, this semester is finally over and i am setting in the subway&#8217;s waiting for my train back home. and right now the this place is playing one of my favorite song <em>you belong with me</em> by <em>Taylor Swift</em></p>

<p>Overall, this semester is kind nice. I tried a few new stuffs and i found that i liked them:)</p>

<p>In the beginning of this semester, i thought i might have some more time spend with that awesome girl, that girl who dumped but i still care about, etc. but it just didn&#8217;t happen, we just met a few time. but it still felt great, actually. can anyone give me one good reason to stop thinking of her:(</p>

<p>Also, i put some time on that team in school, it didn&#8217;t end up like i excepted before, but i didn&#8217;t want to talk about it that much, it just ok and i am really looking forward to continue this in next semester.</p>

<p>In the end of this semester, i met a few great people in Beijing. the first one is Xavier, we&#8217;ve been known for like a year, and look at him, he already start him second startup company and they looks promising. we talk about technic stuffs and what filed might have chance for us, etc. the incredible part is that he still remember how we met at first time, we both take the wrong subway and get off at wrong station. that&#8217;s fun. we will be partner, in the future, i think:)</p>

<p>And yesterday, that was a really nice day:) I might remember that day for a while. It just simply fun and nice. she was the receptionist girl at that time when i first met her, in the company where i got my first job interview. yeah, it about a year ago, i felt her was <strong>cute</strong> at that time, but actually, we didn&#8217;t talk much.</p>

<p>Yesterday, i finally got a chance to met her and not doing any kinds of interviews, instead we played billiards and had dinner together:) I lost the billiards game to her, but i didn&#8217;t feel ashamed at all, LOL. then we went to a barbecue restaurant that i like a lot. it was a nice place with fun shows to watch. and I gave out my first <strong>on stage</strong> dance in that place:( which, right not i still can not believe that i actually did those things.</p>

<p>She is still cute, besides i felt like we have a lot in common so that we didn&#8217;t end up like running out of topics to talk about, which i was kinda afraid before we met. also, her personality is good, just like i excepted.</p>

<p>She said she had a good time that night, more that once. which I am not sure if she really mean it or not:) but anyway, it&#8217;s always good to here stuffs like this.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how she think of me, but i think we will met again, then, i will win the billiard game, at least:)</p>

<p>Also there&#8217;re some funny parts i think i should also mention in here.</p>

<ol>
<li>I lost the billiards game, i did make some brilliant shots. but somehow, i just lose.</li>
<li>When we got to the restaurant, we had to siting right next to each other, on the one side of the table. but i like setting in front of people, i thought that&#8217;s more comfortable. we both sitting in the one side of that table just looks like much more intimate. The reason we do this is because that table has a really  good view of the show, which made it less awkward.</li>
<li>luckily, i think she liked the show.</li>
<li>when we about to got back, in the bus station.

<ul>
<li>she said <strong>are you sure you can find your way back to the hotel? should i take you to there?</strong></li>
<li>i replied <strong>i think i can, besides, my hotel&#8217;s traffic is not that good&#8230; </strong></li>
<li>then, she yelled at me <strong>who says i want to take you to the hotel? i just want to take you to a subway station, blahblah&#8230;</strong></li>
<li>OK, that was awkward enough. haha ;(</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s probably how i end this semester, the summer vacation is starting from right now, let&#8217;s enjoy it yay :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>It&#8217;s been a while</h3>

<p>yeah, it&#8217;s been a while since i got back from holiday. and i got so much work to do lately, personal and school stuffs.</p>

<p>first of all, i confirmed with my teacher that the team we have now, needs new guys and needs them badly. the members we have now are great, but they have their own stuffs to care take of and i have no right to ask them to do anything, so i totally understand them.</p>

<p>second, about the goal out group needs to accomplished, it&#8217;s kinda big and hard. so, i hope the new guys grow more quick:) who knows. they are young, motivated, that&#8217;s good. i think.</p>

<p>I think i am about to give a <strong>public presentation</strong> in a few days later, in school. so, there&#8217;s a great chance to let people to know me better. also, there might be another chance of meeting the right person. so, i need to get it prepared well. and i think i do. and that&#8217;s kinda funny.</p>

<p>I do a few so-called-interview today. that&#8217;s another funny story:)</p>

<p>I met a really great girl last week, yeah, she is really great but i don&#8217;t think we will end up well. she is too great for me. i got her number which i won&#8217;t call in the near future.</p>

<p>that last thing is, i met vivian tonight again. which i don&#8217;t have a clue what we will talk about. so i just give her a stuffs i brought from holiday. again, i didn&#8217;t think i will give it to her, because i decided not to talk to her long time ago.  but, it just happened.</p>

<p>I just can not move on. that&#8217;s sad:( but i will just keep trying.</p>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/05/17/great-article-about-troublshooting-a-server-in-first-five-minutes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>I didn&#8217;t write this, i found the post a few days ago and i think it can be very helpful, so i make a copy here.</h2>

<h3><a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">Original Link Here</a></h3>

<h1>First 5 Minutes Troubleshooting A Server</h1>

<p>Back when our team was dealing with operations, optimization and scalability at <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">our previous company</a>, we had our fair share of troubleshooting poorly performing applications and infrastructures of various sizes, often large (think CNN or the World Bank). Tight deadlines, “exotic” technical stacks and lack of information usually made for memorable experiences.</p>

<p>The cause of the issues was rarely obvious: here are a few things we usually got started with.</p>

<h3>Get some context</h3>

<p>Don’t rush on the servers just yet, you need to figure out how much is already known about the server and the specifics of the issues. You don’t want to waste your time (trouble) shooting in the dark.</p>

<p>A few “must have”:</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly are the symptoms of the issue? Unresponsiveness? Errors?</li>
<li>When did the problem start being noticed?</li>
<li>Is it reproducible?</li>
<li>Any pattern (e.g. happens every hour)?</li>
<li>What were the latest changes on the platform (code, servers, stack)?</li>
<li>Does it affect a specific user segment (logged in, logged out, geographically located…)?</li>
<li>Is there any documentation for the architecture (physical and logical)?</li>
<li><strong>Is there a monitoring platform?</strong> Munin, Zabbix, Nagios, <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>… Anything will do.</li>
<li><strong>Any (centralized) logs?</strong>. Loggly, Airbrake, Graylog…</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two ones are the most convenient sources of information, but don’t expect too much: they’re also the ones usually painfully absent. Tough luck, make a note to get this corrected and move on.</p>

<h3>Who’s there?</h3>

<pre><code>$ w
$ last
</code></pre>

<p>Not critical, but you’d rather not be troubleshooting a platform others are playing with. One cook in the kitchen is enough.</p>

<h3>What was previously done?</h3>

<pre><code>$ history
</code></pre>

<p>Always a good thing to look at; combined with the knowledge of who was on the box earlier on. Be responsible by all means, being admin shouldn’t allow you to break ones privacy.</p>

<p>A quick mental note for later, you may want to update the environment variable <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> to keep track of the time those commands were ran. Nothing is more frustrating than investigating an outdated list of commands…</p>

<h3>What is running?</h3>

<pre><code>$ pstree -a
$ ps aux
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>ps aux</code> tends to be pretty verbose, <code>pstree -a</code> gives you a nice condensed view of what is running and who called what.</p>

<h3>Listening services</h3>

<pre><code>$ netstat -ntlp
$ netstat -nulp
$ netstat -nxlp
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to prefer running them separately, mainly because I don’t like looking at all the services at the same time. <code>netstat -nalp</code> will do to though. Even then, I’d ommit the <code>numeric</code> option (IPs are more readable IMHO).</p>

<p>Identify the running services and whether they’re expected to be running or not. Look for the various listening ports. You can always match the PID of the process with the output of <code>ps aux</code>; this can be quite useful especially when you end up with 2 or 3 Java or Erlang processes running concurrently.</p>

<p>We usual prefer to have more or less specialized boxes, with a low number of services running on each one of them. If you see 3 dozens of listening ports you probably should make a mental note of investigating this further and see what can be cleaned up or reorganized.</p>

<h3>CPU and RAM</h3>

<pre><code>$ free -m
$ uptime
$ top
$ htop
</code></pre>

<p>This should answer a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any free RAM? Is it swapping?</li>
<li>Is there still some CPU left? How many CPU cores are available on the server? Is one of them overloaded?</li>
<li>What is causing the most load on the box? What is the load average?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hardware</h3>

<pre><code>$ lspci
$ dmidecode
$ ethtool
</code></pre>

<p>There are still a lot of bare-metal servers out there, this should help with;</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying the RAID card (with BBU?), the CPU, the available memory slots. This may give you some hints on potential issues and/or performance improvements.</li>
<li>Is your NIC properly set? Are you running in half-duplex? In 10MBps? Any TX/RX errors?</li>
</ul>


<h3>IO Performances</h3>

<pre><code>$ iostat -kx 2
$ vmstat 2 10
$ mpstat 2 10
$ dstat --top-io --top-bio
</code></pre>

<p>Very useful commands to analyze the overall performances of your backend;</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking the disk usage: has the box a filesystem/disk with 100% disk usage?</li>
<li>Is the swap currently in use (si/so)?</li>
<li>What is using the CPU: system? User? Stolen (VM)?</li>
<li><code>dstat</code> is my all-time favorite. What is using the IO? Is MySQL sucking up the resources? Is it your PHP processes?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mount points and filesystems</h3>

<pre><code>$ mount
$ cat /etc/fstab
$ vgs
$ pvs
$ lvs
$ df -h
$ lsof %2BD / /* beware not to kill your box */
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>How many filesystems are mounted?</li>
<li>Is there a dedicated filesystem for some of the services? (MySQL by any chance..?)</li>
<li>What are the filesystem mount options: noatime? default? Have some filesystem been re-mounted as read-only?</li>
<li>Do you have any disk space left?</li>
<li>Is there any big (deleted) files that haven’t been flushed yet?</li>
<li>Do you have room to extend a partition if disk space is an issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Kernel, interrupts and network usage</h3>

<pre><code>$ sysctl -a | grep ...
$ cat /proc/interrupts
$ cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack /* may take some time on busy servers */
$ netstat
$ ss -s
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Are your IRQ properly balanced across the CPU? Or is one of the core overloaded because of network interrupts, raid card, …?</li>
<li>How much is swappinness set to? 60 is good enough for workstations, but when it come to servers this is generally a bad idea: you do not want your server to swap… ever. Otherwise your swapping process will be locked while data is read/written to the disk.</li>
<li>Is <code>conntrack_max</code> set to a high enough number to handle your traffic?</li>
<li>How long do you maintain TCP connections in the various states (<code>TIME_WAIT</code>, …)?</li>
<li><code>netstat</code> can be a bit slow to display all the existing connections, you may want to use <code>ss</code> instead to get a summary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.lognormal.com/blog/2012/09/27/linux-tcpip-tuning/">Linux TCP tuning</a> for some more pointer as to how to tune your network stack.</p>

<h3>System logs and kernel messages</h3>

<pre><code>$ dmesg
$ less /var/log/messages
$ less /var/log/secure
$ less /var/log/auth
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Look for any error or warning messages; is it spitting issues about the number of connections in your conntrack being too high?</li>
<li>Do you see any hardware error, or filesystem error?</li>
<li>Can you correlate the time from those events with the information provided beforehand?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cronjobs</h3>

<pre><code>$ ls /etc/cron* %2B cat
$ for user in $(cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:); do crontab -l -u $user; done
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Is there any cron job that is running too often?</li>
<li>Is there some user’s cron that is “hidden” to the common eyes?</li>
<li>Was there a backup of some sort running at the time of the issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Application logs</h3>

<p>There is a lot to analyze here, but it’s unlikely you’ll have time to be exhaustive at first. Focus on the obvious ones, for example in the case of a LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apache &amp; Nginx</strong>; chase down access and error logs, look for <code>5xx</code> errors, look for possible <code>limit_zone</code> errors.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong>; look for errors in the <code>mysql.log</code>, trace of corrupted tables, innodb repair process in progress. Looks for slow logs and define if there is disk/index/query issues.</li>
<li><strong>PHP-FPM</strong>; if you have php-slow logs on, dig in and try to find errors (php, mysql, memcache, …). If not, set it on.</li>
<li><strong>Varnish</strong>; in <code>varnishlog</code> and <code>varnishstat</code>, check your hit/miss ratio. Are you missing some rules in your config that let end-users hit your backend instead?</li>
<li><strong>HA-Proxy</strong>; what is your backend status? Are your health-checks successful? Do you hit your max queue size on the frontend or your backends?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After these first 5 minutes (give or take 10 minutes) you should have a better understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is running.</li>
<li>Whether the issue seems to be related to IO/hardware/networking or configuration (bad code, kernel tuning, …).</li>
<li>Whether there’s a pattern you recognize: for example a bad use of the DB indexes, or too many apache workers.</li>
</ul>


<p>You may even have found the actual root cause. If not, you should be in a good place to start digging further, with the knowledge that you’ve covered the obvious.</p>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/05/15/port-mapping-slash-forwarding-with-iptables-in-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>We got a problem with the networking in my dorm and laboratory, if outgoing traffic port is 3389, the connection will be banned. so, we need to figure a way out to connect a Windows server&#8217;s 3389 port, which is suck, i mean, Windows sucks.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>I connected to one of the linux server which is in the same lan with Suck Windows Server with port, let&#8217;s say 63389. the the linux with redirect the connection from 63389 to Suck Windows Server&#8217;s port 3389.</p>

<p>this is what i did in the linux server:</p>

<pre><code>    iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING 1 -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 63389 -j DNAT --to-destination SUCK-WIN-IP:3389
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 3389 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>the second target <strong> MASQUERADE </strong> is a really handy thing, it will be acting like SNAT most times, but it can also auto-adjust some connection problems with extra <strong>COST</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Summary for the past</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>the &#8220;thing&#8221; i do in school, still making very slow progress, some of the guys starting contribute to the group, i am glad to see that.</p></li>
<li><p>i made a small web app called find-the-one for guokr group&#8217;s searching. it works fine, i learn some new technic and it might be helpful in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li>the very first redone of i made that is because I was trying to find if there&#8217;s any girl i might found interesting in tianjin. so i wrote that app, it seems that my hope <strong>didn&#8217;t come true.</strong></li>
<li>but, there is quite amount of people like that app and using it. so, i am glad i can make another stuff people like.</li>
<li>that app is in the Guokr.com&#8217;s homepage :) it got about 1000pv in it&#8217;s first day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h1>Some other stuff</h1>

<p>  basically, i write this just want to say， i am trying so hard to moving on, and i think somehow, it might work :)</p>

<p>  And there&#8217;s another interesting story, there&#8217;s a front desk girl i ‘kinda’ like from the company that gave me the very first job offer but i didn&#8217;t accept in the end. she saw my WeiBo about IronMan3, and we talk about the comment &#8216;haha hahaha hahahaha&#8217; i gave to that movie, i went great and i found her interesting too, and she like&#8217;s billiard too. so, I might have chance to see her again, but not interview involved this time! good luck.</p>

<p>  One last thing, i am gonna to re-watch the An <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1866479/" title="The Avengers">The Avengers</a> again, since i just finished the IronMan 3 a few days ago.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>hi, it&#8217;s been a while:) i just had some busy weeks and finally, i think i can take a break now. i can spend more time with friends and my personal work, plus some go on dates, if i am <strong>luckily</strong> enough.</p>

<p>i had been playing multiply roles for some weeks.</p>

<h3>System Administrator</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since the data on our servers got destroyed by mistake, i have to do that form scratch and got some new problems, mostly because we now work at a new lab with different networking enviroment.  it took some extra work. and also i have to re-write and setup our team wiki pages. i think that wiki is important but some of the guys in the team didn&#8217;t think that way, fine. now i can say that with confident that i am fully qualified for a <strong>SA</strong> position:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>HR guy</h3>

<ul>
<li>All right, it&#8217;s not that <strong>official</strong>, but i do have some rights at this team right now, and i did have received some resumes and <strong>hire</strong> someone to do stuffs with us, LOL. hoping i hired the right guy. and i am still want people to work with us, see the recruiting ad here:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf" title="download os-recuriting.pdf">PDF version: http://www.sunus.me/downloads/os-recuriting.pdf</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo">HTML version: http://www.readability.com/articles/6feglmeo</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>i am waiting, join us soon:)</li>
</ul>


<h3><em>Talker</em></h3>

<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what the fuck the <em>talker</em> is ? but i can explain what that is, i talked with some of the main members our this team, asked their thougths on this <strong>thing</strong> we are doing right now, what&#8217;re they thinking and what they want to do next. and their answer is just, let&#8217;s say, simple.</li>
<li>I used to have pretty high admire on them, and i used to think i can count on them. but right now, i think i have to re-consider those thoughts. obviously they have other pressing matters right now, i have no comment on this and i have no right to judge them. but, i have mine too, and it&#8217;s the main reason why i came back this year. it&#8217;s definitely <strong>NOT</strong> what we do right now. if you don&#8217;t have motivation or this s not interested to you any more, you can quit. because at this point, i just find out every one right now are replaceable, i can not see the quality/ability we need in you right now, but, i once think you have those.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Secretary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes, secretary. I wrote a lot those days and i knew what i know my writing skills sucks. glad i have some guy to help me. final, i finished those crap, I can not believe some parts of those paper are written by me.</li>
<li>besides writing papers, I went around, hand in papers to different people, get their signature. even printed the paper.</li>
<li>A teacher call me everyday around 9 am to wake up and go to he office, to write.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Team Leader</h3>

<ul>
<li>i don&#8217;t like this title, but i did have those title in some document files. since i talked to the guys in the team, i have to think and assigned tasks about we need to do at this point and future as well to them, based on their skills, attitute and motivation. i think i am doing ok, hoping they will do the same:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Developer</h3>

<ul>
<li>yeah, that&#8217;s what i love most, luckily i found i need some simple but basic feature/service but it didn&#8217;t exist. so i write a script to get it done and i am using it on a daily basis. of course i open source of this project at <strong><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">github The Backup-Box</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sunuslee/bub">The Backup-Box </a> it can sync/backup you files using the services provided by stuffs like dropbox, google drive, amazon cloud but offers a feature that allowed you to select any files on your machine and get it backed up, <strong>you don&#8217;t have to manually put those files into the directory in the cloud drive</strong></li>
<li>yesterday i found the first version code of hub looks ugly and seems confuse, so i rewrite most of them, it now looks much like my code:)</li>
<li>i start to take license seriously, so i chose <em>MIT Open Source License</em> to publish bub.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Student</h3>

<ul>
<li>i went to a Linux class in school, but i ran off in less than ten minutes.because i don&#8217;t find any nice girl in the classroom.</li>
<li>kidding, i got other stuff to take care of at that time.</li>
<li>kidding, again. if there is nice girl in the classroom, that &#8216;other stuff&#8217; can certainly wait another hour:)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Some other stuffs</h2>

<ul>
<li>i am glad i still stay in the campus and did&#8217;t want to <strong>quit</strong> again. this is a quit week and i don&#8217;t really enjoy this kind of busy, it&#8217;s not what i want. i just want to do <strong>my thing</strong> and get it done perfectly.</li>
<li>i don&#8217;t even got time to swim, but i got time to swim and writing blog today, it feels great. i am making progress in the pool.</li>
<li>i watched a great movie called <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/"><em>waiting alone</em> (<strong>http://movie.douban.com/subject/1308741/</strong>)</a> , i found it just like a mirror to me and i just found my <strong>Liu Rong</strong> in my life, or maybe i knew it for quite a while but afraid to admit it? god, i wish i can watch this movie earlier.</li>
<li>i will watch another great movie <em>Django Unchained</em> this week. i should watch it earlier but just too busy this week, now that i got time, i will watch it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Something is missing ?</h2>

<p>nope:)
good night and wish me luck.</p>

<p>因为ungetc的原因，代码请用gcc编译vc/vs对ungetc的处理不很好。</p>

<p>fo2_bug就是2b的字符串反转函数,把字符串ins反转之后存到outs.在main调用fo2_bug之后。会有点异想不到的事情花生～～</p>

<p>有同学说说fo2_bug这个函数的bug在哪儿，bug的症状是啥，为什么会出现bug&#8230;怎么fix就随便吧，太轻松了～</p>

<p>答对的女同学我请吃饭吧..</p>

<p>男同学，嗯。。送一个月高速PROXY或者迅雷会员吧&#8230;.<sup>^</sup></p>

    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2013/03/25/0x17</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>hi, there.
yeah, i am gonna turn 0x17 tomorrow, that&#8217;s another whole new year for me and i think i just end my time in 0x16.
after reading my last year&#8217;s post, the theme of my 0x16 is &#8216;trying hard to be a guy that deserves you&#8217; , i think i failed, but i will continue to do so in my upcoming 0x17 times :)</p>

<p><strong>I failed to win her heart :&lt;</strong></p>

<p>but anyway, my 0x16 times turned out to be good. i got a nice job in the early year, i learned a lot from those awesome guys i met in the dev team and i gained a lot, i wish to be as good as them in the beginning. but in the end, i got acknowledged by them. it&#8217;s not easy, but it&#8217;s quite a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong>I really enjoyed thoses times in beijing, writing codes and getting paid and having tons of fun with new friends</strong></p>

<p>then, i quit that job and got back to school, plan to having some normal college student&#8217;s life. that&#8217;s, mostly a serious relationship with someone i like.</p>

<p><strong>I need some motivation to be excellent againn</strong></p>

<p>Also, this year, the main reason of me quitting the job and getting back to schol is, i really really want some <em>changes</em>, though i don&#8217;t know what that is, but it will come eventually, right?</p>

<p><strong>I already made some of those, namely from user-friendly linux distribution to a more flexible one, from linux to OS X, from vim to emacs, etc</strong></p>

<p>I think this year will be awesome, and i&#8217;d love to take all the challenges and opportunity in the upcoming days.</p>

<p><strong>i will do more sports!</strong></p>

<p><strong>happy birthday and good luck for whatever that is.</strong></p>

<p>END OF 0x16.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>First of all, it all because my MacBookPro&#8217;s xl2tp utils can not work under my school&#8217;s networking enviroment. so this is how the post is born.</p>

<p>I have been digging with those stuffs for almost a week, and now, finally i get it rolling and it seems awesome. this post will talks about netfilter known as iptables and ip route policy. and some technic/tool like tcpdump will be involved as well.</p>

<h1>Environment</h1>

<p>The environment i have is like this below:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------    -----------------
| Slow          |    | Fast          |
| Internet-1    |    | Internet-2    |
| 10.10.149.1   |    | 123.150.232.1 |
-----------------    -----------------
         |             |
[eth0.2] |             |[ppp0]
         |             |
        --------------------------
        | Route, Running Linux   |
        | br-lan: 192.168.1.1    | [br-lan]      ------------------------
        | ppp0:   123.150.232.74 | --------------| Other Machines in Lan|
        | eth0.2: 10.10.149.4    |               ------------------------
        --------------------------
        |                        |
[br-lan]|                        |[br-lan]
        |                        |
        |                        |
        |                        |
  -------------------------      ----------------------
  |ArchLinux              |      | MacBook            |
  |eth0: 192.168.1.245    |      | en0:192.168.1.169  |
  |ppp0: 180.134.135.173  |      |                    |
  -------------------------      ----------------------
        |
        |
        |
        |
  ------------------
  | Fast           |
  | Internet-3     |
  | 180.134.135.1  |
  ------------------
</code></pre>

<p>   after connect the wires. there is three <strong> physic wires </strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong>Slow Internet-1 </strong>this is the only one that connects to outside my dorm. via route&#8217;s port WAN.</li>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong> ArchLinux </strong> this one is in a Route&#8217;s port #1 LAN</li>
<li><strong>Route</strong> <------> <strong> MacBook </strong> same as above, using Route&#8217;s port #2 LAN</li>
</ul>


<p>  There is also something to be noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <strong>ppp0</strong> in <strong>Route</strong> is a high-speed connection(VPN). it needs to go though <strong>eth0.2</strong> to connect the VPN-server, then it will generate a Virtual Network InterFace, that is, ppp0.</p></li>
<li><p>the another <strong>ppp0</strong> in <strong>ArchLinux</strong> is also the high-speed connection. but firstly, it goes to <strong>Route</strong>, then the VPN-server.</p></li>
<li><p>in this environment, you can consider those ppp0 as real NICs that are connected to the internet as well.</p></li>
<li><p>So, we can say eth0.2 and two ppp0 are all outgoing Interfaces.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Solutions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>   I repeat what i want to accomplished here:</p>

<p>   1 .    i want my MacBook can connected to the internet.</p>

<p>   2 .    i want my MacBook&#8217;s internet connection to be as <strong>FAST</strong> as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>   Before we get started, there&#8217;s something we can do and can&#8217;t do, in general.</p>

<p>   1 .    Seting the <strong>default route</strong> to 180.134.135.1 for ArchLinux and a route to lan. We do this because we want all the trafftic goes to a fast internet connecting while we keep the connection to the other machines in the lan still work.</p>

<pre><code># route add -net 192.168.1.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
# route add default gw 180.134.135.1 dev ppp0
</code></pre>

<p>   2 .    Because there is other machines in the lan, so we can not set 123.150.232.1 as <strong>default route</strong> for Route, just like the ArchLinux. there is only <strong> me </strong> can access the Fast Internet-2.( The <strong>Benefit</strong> of being me or with me :) lol! )</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The Slow Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   Making the MacBook can connect to the internet, but it just too slow for me. Just set up machines and route like the diagram above, it will result this:</p>

<p>   1 .  the ArchLinux using Internet-3.</p>

<p>   2 .  the MacBookPro using Slow-Internet-1</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The A Little Bit Faster Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   Making the MacBook Using ArchLinux&#8217;s Internet-3 and the ArchLinux still keep unchanged in Slow Solution. This solution requires those steps.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>  in the MacBook, change default route from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.245</p>

<p> In MacBook:
 # route add default 192.168.1.245
 # route del default 192.168.1.1</p></li>
<li><p>  in ArchLinux, set up a route policy/rule</p>

<ul>
<li><p>  the packets that comes from MacBook(192.168.1.169), Using the gateway of Internet-3.</p>

<pre><code>In ArchLinux:
# add a empty table to route table
echo '7375 SunusRules' &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
# add a default route rule to newly create table SunusRules
ip route add default via 180.134.135.173 dev ppp0 table SunusRules
# add this table to routing rules, all the packet comes from MacBook, apply this route rule.
ip rule add from 192.168.1.169 table SunusRules
</code></pre></li>
<li><p> We are done here.</p></li>
<li><p> In fact, i don&#8217;t think add a route rule here is necessarily, but anyway, it&#8217;s a good time to get the first impression of what this can do. which we will make the best use of it in next Solution.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Ultimate And More Fast Solution, so far</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>   As you may think, why we still didn&#8217;t use Fast-Internet-2 yet. Now, it&#8217;s time to rolling on this connection! Let the MacBook and only MacBook use this connection.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> In fact, this is a kinda complicated process, we need to do the following stuffs to put it all together to work properly.</p>

<p> 1 . Leave MacBook&#8217;s default (192.168.1.1) untouched.</p>

<p> 2 . Let the Route know, if a packet is come from MacBook(192.168.1.169), sets the <strong>Gateway</strong> of this connection to 1123.150.232.1 and <strong>Outgoing Interface</strong> to ppp0. because at this point, only ppp0 can connect to it&#8217;s <strong>Gateway</strong>(123.150.232.1)</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>policy routing</strong> is the first magic.

<ul>
<li>as most of us might already knew that, the linux kernel only allow exactly one <strong>efficient default</strong> in <strong>route table</strong>.</li>
<li>so this needs is beyond a simple <code>route</code> command can do. but, don&#8217;t worry. net-tools is out of date for so long, let us introduce the new <code>ip</code> tools to do this for us.</li>
<li>basically, this is still maintain that one kernel default route in route table, but, it allow us to add custom route table based on our needs, and set up the right condition. e.g <strong>the packet&#8217;s source address/net</strong> or <strong>the incoming interface</strong>, etc see <code>ip route help</code>.

<ul>
<li><p>the steps to make this happened are:</p>

<pre><code># add a table id and table name to the route table database, just make sure they are unique.
echo '7375 sunusroute' &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
# check if that succeeded, the out should be empty.
ip route show table sunusroute
# then, add route rules to this newly create table.
# set the default route/gateway of this table
ip route add default via 123.150.232.1 dev ppp0
# finally, add a rule to tell the kernel, under what circumstance,
the packet should use the route table from what we just set,
instead of the default route rules. we just set this simple rule, if a packet is from 192.168.1.169, then apply the rules in route table sunusroute.
ip rule add from 192.168.1.169 table sunusroute
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>check if those are valid by:</p>

<pre><code>ip rule show
&gt;&gt; 0: from all lookup local
&gt;&gt; 32761: from 192.168.1.169 lookup sunusroute
&gt;&gt; many-more-lines-of-other-rules
ip route show table sunusroute
&gt;&gt; default via 123.150.108.1 dev ppp0
ip route flush cache
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the last command <code>ip route flush cache</code> is just a precaution, in case the old rules in cache might do something nasty.</p></li>
<li><p>we are done in this step.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> 3 . Also, Since the Route&#8217;s default gateway isn&#8217;t 123.150.232.1, so it&#8217;s a must to set packet&#8217;s <strong>source address</strong> to 123.150.232.74. so here we will do a <strong>SNAT</strong> magic.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>we are officially meet the iptables here, the firewall of the linux, a great tool for many other usages as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>the iptables consists by some tables, and those tables has some chains. the packet need to go all the way from the very first chain to the very last one. so that this packet can be send/receive correctly. during the packet&#8217;s travel in those tables and chains, it might be modify, accept, drop or reject, we can even add marks to those packets so that we can debug them.</li>
<li>here is a brief image of how a packets goes.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://sunus.me/images/iptables_traverse.jpg" title="iptables_traverse" alt="iptables packetes traversal path" /></p>

<ul>
<li>obviously, what we want the route to do is:</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>forward the packets from 192.168.1.169 to interface ppp0 with the right gateway 123.150.231.1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>follow the diagram, the packets should go through the tables and chains in the order of</p>

<ol>
<li>[packet come in from ppp0]</li>
<li>[raw-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[mangle-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[filter-PREROUTING]</li>
<li>[ROUTING-DESICION]</li>
<li>[mangle-FORWARD]</li>
<li>[filter-FORWARD]</li>
<li>[ROUTING-DESICION]</li>
<li>[mangle-POSTROUTING]</li>
<li>[nat-POSTROUTING]</li>
<li>[packet come out from ppp0]</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>I once not sure/doubt about what those <strong>ROUTING-DESICION</strong> do, after my research, i think it&#8217;s just decide what <strong>route</strong> to use, basically, it just look up the routing table and get a <strong>route</strong> to use.</p></li>
<li><p>so, what we need to do is, change the packets&#8217;s source address right after the packet go off. that is, in the step ten.</p>

<p> <code>iptables -t nat -o ppp0 -j SNAT --to-address 123.150.232.74</code></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p> 4 . We&#8217;re pretty much done here:)</p>

<p> 5 . Enjoy!</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong> Long time no see </strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hi, there! First of all, happy new year to you and wish you all have a wonderful new year, i give you my very best wishes here:)
Yeah, i did quit my job last year and had theses about 40 days of <strong>AWESOME</strong> holidays in my hometown with my family and friends which is fun and happy. We went to couple of places with views, of course, i took some photos, too. But most of those photos are mountains and some kind of <strong>vulgar</strong> pictures. LOL</p></li>
<li><p>Besides of having fun, i got my MacBook, it&#8217;s a whole new user experiences, which i can not tell it&#8217;s better that Linux or not. but compare to Windows. it&#8217;s definitely a piece of work. Windows sucks, i said it to all the people i care about! :) I am getting used to OS X and i think it&#8217;s more comfortable to develop some <strong>app</strong> on that machine than my old laptop. But it&#8217;s okay, i do Linux-related/python work on my old machine while i am also a newcomer of APP developing. i am getting my motivations back, it just feel much better that i want to and CAN code again!</p></li>
<li><p>Tomorrow i will fly back to school and i don&#8217;t know what that is, i am leading some students to launch a <strong>OpenStack</strong> project in school, even though i don&#8217;t think that will be too much difficult for me, given the current situation we have. but still, i will do the most major work. don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s good for me or not, just wait and see how it goes. Also, i want some nice <strong>girls</strong> who&#8217;s interested in front-end to help me, i don&#8217;t know if she exists in my school.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the same-old-boring topic, i can not stop thinking about her, i know she also had a great great time on holiday, she sure did! so, let&#8217;s just hope she is still available. I even pray for that in a old temple. kidding! i didn&#8217;t do that:) so, still, chances are slim but i still don&#8217;t want to give up on this girl who had stolen my heart for months, in some point stolen my codes as well:&lt; hoping i can make this right. We didn&#8217;t send a word to each other in this whole holiday and i am not sure if she still remember me or not. but, i had hard time picking gifts for her and lucky(or not?) enough, i got something gift picking advice from my friends and sisters. so, just wait and see if she like that or not.</p></li>
<li><p>I am Back and I miss you all! the new semester could be a interesting one, not because of the school or class but you and all the uncertain changes and opportunity i wanted for a while!!</p></li>

    <link href="http://sunus.me/blog/2012/12/30/pull-yourself-together/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-30T00:11:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://sunus.me/blog/2012/12/30/pull-yourself-together</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Making Changes</h4>

<p>Yes, i am writing this blog using <strong>EMACS</strong>, the ultimate text editor, i am so umfamiliar with it right now, but, i am getting better:)</p>

<p>A lot stuffs going on lately, i&#8217;ve been weighed the pros and cons about some certain things for quite a long time.
But now, I don&#8217;t think i will <strong>LOST</strong> again, because i believe i made the right decision, just like the one i made in 2010.
With no regrets but only excitement. I know this will become all new to me, since i regain my love for this university, which i&#8217;ve called it CRAPLAND for so long. I am really looking forward to what is happening next, i bet you will, too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Career</p>

<p>  The first and foremost one is about my intern, or i&#8217;d prefer to called it <strong>career</strong> :)</p>

<p>  I decided to <strong>quit</strong>, if school not kick me out right now.</p>

<p>  I love my development team, my leader and brothers. yeah, we&#8217;ve became really really close friends!</p>

<p>  I love what i do and what i will do if i remain stay there, that&#8217;s something i wish i could get hands on in a year ago, and i finally get the chance to play with it. the Amazing linux kernel, filesystem, and Networking stuffs.
And i will definitely take that offer if i got it six month ago, i wanted to write some serious code back then, besides the payment is good.</p>

<p>  but, everything has a beginning has an end, that&#8217;s how things work and i can only accept it. Since, i am no longer the guy i was six month ago, i am <strong>less</strong> motivated, but i will change.</p>

<p>  That change will not happen if i stay in company, or Beijing. and a <strong>push</strong> just came in time, letting me easier to make the call.</p>

<p>  So, here i am, back to Tianjin and hopefully i can pull myself together soon.</p>

<p>  And, I am gonna thank those guy who along the way with me, helping me making the decisions, thank you!</p></li>
<li><p>Myself</p>

<p>  I wanted this subtitle as &#8216;Relationship&#8217; or something like that, but it&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s kinda a problem of mine and I have to deal with it very carefully and hopefully it turn out to be good.</p>

<p>  I really really miss her during the days i was in Beijing, just right after i finished the project in company, i keep thinking about her. i can help myself.</p>

<p>  luckily i got some chances to see her sometimes, those moments are wonderful and I want more.</p>

<p>  We use to hang out frequently and maybe that why i am always motivated back in the days i am in school, it&#8217;s a huge lose if i can not have that anymore:(</p>

<p>  We had pizza at <strong>pizzahut</strong> last night, and walked in the snow, talking and laughing about her exs and some of my awkward stories. for quite a long i always thought we&#8217;ve never went out on rain or something like that, but this time we got snow, white, pretty snow. so, overall it&#8217;s feels nice! I never walk with a girl in the snow, so, luckily me, for i picked the right day. but, i was planed to buy her something, just like the story we talked earlier, it&#8217;s about a couple in a shop, the boy buy girl a cloth while she is trying it in changing room, and after she came out, the boy ask the girl to run, like escape and steal that cloth. yeah, i actually planned to do that, but.. we didn&#8217;t find a nice shop yesterday night:(</p>

<ul>
<li>NOTES

<ol>
<li><p>Our first official date was go to the movie, after we brought the tickets, i suggested we eat at pizzahut nearby the theater, but then she wanted to eat at a cheaper restaurant &#8220;yoshinoya&#8221;. at that time i thought maybe she don&#8217;t want me to spend too much money on our first date, but it just turned out that she is just <strong>simply</strong> don&#8217;t like pizzahut:(</p></li>
<li><p>That movie is total crap, we were all confused about that movies.</p></li>
<li><p>I still keep those tickets. the <strong>only</strong> movie we watch together.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought she loves going to the movies, in fact, she doesn&#8217;t and i, ask her to movies for like thousand times.. silly me!!</p></li>
<li><p>I asked her to movie again, TODAY.. dumb, no wonder her dump you in the first place. :(:(</p></li>
<li><p>NOTES above shows I need to get to know her more!</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>  but, the sad part is, i don&#8217;t know when we can meet again and this is really bothering me. i didn&#8217;t cherish the time we had before and took it for grant for so long. anyway, new year is about to come and i will post later.</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>hi you, sorry i recently had so much stuffs want to write, but i again again to tell myself, you have gotta learn the iptables first, then move this blog with the domain to a new place, then write. but, i just found out it doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with the iptables, it&#8217;s apache that do the job. so, i give myself sometime to set up the apache, meanwhile, write those post while i still can remember things:)</p>

<p>first of all, i had great fun at Dec 11, knows as 11.11. i hung out with a very close friend, and we had great meal and watched the moveie The Bourne Legacy, even thought i watched this movie before, but, it&#8217;s okay to watch it again, when you have someone to keep you company:) i knew she had some difficult time with study and the other stuffs, but, anyway. Since we both knew the 11.11 means nothing to us, it just make this day much easier. i had the girl i care about and she had a boyfriend she love very much:) so, i think i am not the ones who got a reason to celebrity that day, because i am FALLING IN LOVE with someone, and i think now everyone knows that. but anway, who needs another friends when you had a friend like she, it just make my life easier, at least when i felt down, she&#8217;s always the one i can talk to. and she understand me more than any of my friends do.</p>

<p>then, back to a another topic. i can not focus on coding recently, lucky enough, i got Taylor Swift&#8217;s songs and coffee, but, i just miss her more and more, she is such  a awesome girl and i never met a girl like her before. and all of a suddenly, when i walk on the road to eat, i came up with this one:</p>

<p>&#8220;she is the source of my source, sorry about the bugs, blame her!&#8221;</p>

<p>i even post a question on Quora, to see and share with other programmers who feel the same way:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Programmers/Are-there-any-romantic-programming-programmer-quotes">http://www.quora.com/Programmers/Are-there-any-romantic-programming-programmer-quotes</a></p>

<p>i really really wish i can spend more that with her, when i had chance, to tell her how i felt about her, face to face.</p>

<p>and another topic, about her, again,(why always her!!) now, i just can not figure out what is REALLY going on, so, wish me luck.</p>

<p>i watch a short video &#8220;The Last&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc3NTg4MjAw.html">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc3NTg4MjAw.html</a></p>

<p>it&#8217;s about a guy&#8217;s view on his previous girlfriends and i somehow, want to write one too, even though, i am still alone now.</p>

<p>my version is about some programming language i know and how i felt about them, but trust me, in fact, it&#8217;s</p>

<p>not about programming language, it&#8217;s about her and some other girls:)</p>

<p>the last is about some options i got and i can not decided which one to choose yet. it really kills me, so, i will let</p>

<p>you know when i make the final decision:)</p>

<p>good night:)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I just got back from Tianjin and had some great meat with my friends from my dev team. I&#8217;d been in school like in five days or so, it&#8217;s strange I didn&#8217;t call it crapland :( and here is why I don&#8217;t call it crapland:
First of all, finally, after about half years long waiting, I got a chance to meet Vivian again, yeah, because I really can not come up with any new words to describe her, but, I am lucky enough to see her again. so  thrilled I got the last night before  head off, I just could not sleep and get up very early then just begin to run, Ok, that&#8217;s a little fake:( I didn&#8217;t run. Then, the funny thing is when I just get out of my apartment, I got a feeling like, someone&#8217;s  Dear PERIOD is about to come, and It turned out I was right, The one, the girl I&#8217;ve been miss for so long, got her PERIOD to visit, just one or more hours  ahead of me to see her. so, I wait one more extra day to spend with my friends. that&#8217;s the my 1st day in Tianjin.(Saturday).</p>

<p>Sunday, it&#8217;s absolutely the highlight of this short visit. When I just woke up, seeing my phone got a new  text, somehow I just feel, (AGAIN, how amazing is that?!) it&#8217;s none other than the girl I dream about, finally, gave me a chance to meet her again, just like the old days. Then I had the best three hours of this visit.she showed me some of her designs, even though I am not a fashion guy at all:) but I can tell, she love her works, just like I love my code:) and we went to the drinking shop we used to visit a lot, then, went back to school because she&#8217;s got class to take. also, just like the old days.</p>

<p>P.S.: The only program I wrote those days is the one I call &#8220;wesaid&#8221; in my phone, i wrote this on the first day of this short trip, the night before i meet  you., I use &#8220;wesaid&#8221; to remind me what we said in the last years, on the exact same day. this program intent to be UN-expandable, meaning this is for one phone number and one phone number only, and i won&#8217;t use this on other girls, i promise:) it&#8217;s too dangerous.</p>

<p>and the next a few days was kinda interesting, too. in fact, I know &#8220;MISS Hot Heart Classmate&#8221; for  about a year, we met, passed by for so many times, which leads me became more and more interested about her, and want to get to know her better, Luckily, I ask her out at a &#8220;Perfect Right time&#8221;, her  class was kinda late, she&#8217;s kinda hungry and she loves the hot pot. So, we had a night of hot pot, and we talk a lot, definitely more friendly, interesting more those new-just-get-to-know-couples.  it&#8217;s like a date but I think we both agree that&#8217;s not a date, still, it&#8217;s fun to finally get to know her,  and her didn&#8217;t disappoint me at all, she&#8217;s interested with beautiful smile, and got talent for telling/creating jokes :>
but, I doubt she is good at C programming<sup>^</sup>
and next a few days got little bored but it&#8217;s ok:)
and finally, i get back to Beijing and post this blog. good night. and hope i can see you guys again, soon:)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>hi, i am back to write some post again:)</p>

<p>it&#8217;s the 3rd or 4th blog since a started this kinda life at Beijing, and it&#8217;s just, humm, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s very special times i had. i had some troubles in school, which i really don&#8217;t give it a shit about, and besides, my intern-ship is quite smoothy, or at least i think it that way. our product is about to release at the part that i covered, it looks good to me, even thought that part wasn&#8217;t as mush attractive as kernel and filesystem to me, which i am about to get really deep into those stuffs, but anyway, it&#8217;s gonna end. and i now can really put myself into the field that i love best.</p>

<p>i made some really great friends here, a very lovely girl live across my room, and she can cook for me sometimes, even thought it&#8217;s not that yummy:( and , oh, she&#8217;s a nice and beautiful girl, but, i know we will never hit it off, so, just keep that way and it&#8217;s good. at least i have a good roommate &amp; friends:)</p>

<p>and i also made friends with the guys in our development team, they are really really nice to me, even thought some of them are elder than me, but, yeah, them approved/acknowledge my skills and will let me to help them to solve some problems they had. which i feel kinda proud of myself. good job out there, sunus!</p>

<p>and we hang out a lot, drinking and play polos. it&#8217;s just a lot of fun with them and i think we&#8217;ll become brothers one day;)</p>

<p>and the final, big news, i might get a chance to meet the girl of my dream, again, after she dump me months ago. who knows :(</p>

<p>wish me luck !</p>

<p>bye and wish u a happy mid-autunm festival!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>yeah, after about two months of intern-ship in Beijing, i get back to my sweet home for a couple of days.stay with my family and friends. it&#8217;s  really really happy time spent with them, and my sisters they are doing really really good so i am proud of them :) ps, i bought my mom a new SAMSUNG GALAXY smart phone using my first salary, it did feels great!</p>

<p>and my friends, yeah, i really really want them to  change their names, but i didn&#8217;t get the perfect girl i want , didn&#8217;t bring her to my city then let my friends see how awesome and amazing she is, and how lucky i am if i had a girlfriend like she:) anyway, i still like her a lot even thought i am trying really really hard to meet some new girls and hangout with them, do things we did when we first met, but, they are, they are just NOTHING ON U. and i know now, i can not forget you for sure:( i keep the movie tickets we saw together,  the birthday gifts i wished i could give you by my side,which i know you will like it, but, you never know what that is:( and i also want to finish those drinks on the street, it&#8217;s like one or two more cups, and we can get some free drinks. sorry, i can not remember the exact numbers.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t even know whether you will read this far or not, i don&#8217;t even know whether you will ever come to this blog or not. but if you do, even if i don&#8217;t know whether you had been there for a while or not, it&#8217;s okay.  if i were you, i saw this blog and i know much this guy likes you. i will be crying:) kidding</p>

<p>and my intern-ship goes very smoothly, the company is growing and i am doing kinda good job there. so not much to talk about.</p>

<p>anyway, new chapter of my life goes on, and you are the only missing part of my new chapter.! hoping you can be in it, some day, maybe, perhaps :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, It’s been a while since the last post, isn’t it ? so many things going on those days, I got dumped , yeah, I got dumped by a very amazing and awesome girl that I’ve always talked about.</p>

<p>and some of my friends I played a lot counter-striker with are graduated from university, so no more counter-strike for a while.(OH REALL? I don’t know:D)</p>

<p>they are a bunch of nice guys and brothers to me and I am looking forward to play with them again!</p>

<p>it’s sad, but life moves on, as it always does.</p>

<p>and I came to Beijing on July 1st, (WOW! FINALLY!) I can feel that there is a very exciting , interesting and wonderful journey just right there waiting for me to explore, to experience. and I am ready to embrace all of those wonderful things! such as new opportunities, new apartments and new roommates:) i think some of them is kinda interesting, i am looking forward to meet them:)</p>

<p>let’s talk about what I did recently, finally, I choose the best offer I can get and starting to write some serious codes :) it’s fun and it just really surprise me a lot!</p>

<p>I kind of thoughts that I am kinda good at what I do, that’s coding, but when I FINALLY got here and starting working, I just found out there’s so many people are just really really good at it, too. most of them are older than me, but they just know so so so many skills than I do, I don’t know what I will become a year or two year later, hoping I can be much better than they’re now, lol !</p>

<p>the environment of my workspace is very nice, I am very very satisfied can my very first intern job can be like this. I can get a very nice sleep, and get up anytime I want, then head off to my office. because there’s no such rule that requires you have to be the office before a specific time, this is what I really love about this company! the food here is ok, but I can deal with that. by the way, the front-desk girl is kinda cute and I ACCIDENTALLY  pissed her off several times LOL!, even thought I just got here some day ago, sorry about that:(, but I really really didn’t do those things on purpose, I just don’t know much about the rules..</p>

<p>so, right now I just need to work hard and prove my worth and make more friends and pay some EXTRA attention to the relationships that may just come in, who knows LOL!</p>

<p>anyhow, I still think of you a lot, and I saw a girl like you a lot right in the subway, even thought I knew that girl isn’t you for sure, but my heart just beat faster at that moment. i now can move on with my life, hope u can do the same:)</p>

<p>see you!</p>
