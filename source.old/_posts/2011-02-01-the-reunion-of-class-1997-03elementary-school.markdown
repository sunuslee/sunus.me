when i got into high school,i wanted a reunion party with my elementary  school’s classmates. to see if they’re doing all right and i also wanted to show  what i’ve become during that days with them . and to tell them i will always  remember those guys walk all the way through six years and i TRULY appreciate  it!

when i got into the university , i waned a reunion party with them to.

In this very year,31st Jan,2011. My dream finally came true.We are finally  get back gathering together to do this REUNION stuff.

Girls are getting pretty than ever ! some of them i can still remember what'  they’re look like or sound like . maybe some of them will stay in my memory  forever,just like ROM ^^. yeah,that’s true. It’s not embarrassing to said  that,’cause it has been years and just let the past pass.we all have moved  on!

Boy are getting mature.and we ‘re really having a great time @ party .  The beers didn’t waste a single drip:D

The only thing that i considered as a pity is that there’s a girl,a girl that  i really really want to have a talk with,did NOT show up:<…. sigh,hoping  there’s always another chance out there for me . I just want to have a talk with  her,that’s it.

I am really having a great time this night and i love you all!

UPDATE: We are going to do it AGAIN! IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY! CAN’T WAIT TO SEE  U!
