Now,11:30 pm,i am sitting in the chair,waiting for the Grand Final of KODE5 GLOBAL FINAL.  
yesterday,at the same time,The Chinese Team called DRAGON just had been released from Customs of Russia.  
what the fuck?! i ask myself and came up with nothing.  
an half hour later,they began to warm up,then,The first competitor they gonna to versus was SK-Gaming,one of the most strongest team in the world.  
It is obviously that Team Dragon not only had to conquer their physical problems but also spirits and skills.  
1st round.they won,with some headshot.but it's the only round they played quite well.  
They they got totally owned!Yeah, that was a OWNAGE!  
They tense,so they lose it.There is no doubt about it that No Team could make it with tenseness and physical problems even thought they well in sprite and physical.  
It's just a training match.  
yep,just a training match.  
just stand up and keep moving.  
  
OKOK, the Grand Final is about to begin.keep turning on!  
see ya
