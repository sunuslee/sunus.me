um,the lunch is good,though.but i just don’t like it. So,i quit,to finish this blog that it should have been finalized in the morning.

Back to the topic,as i glad that her little brother just didn’t get into the as university as i do or otherwise,i would have been considered as a litter brother,it sucks.

But,anyway it means nothing to me about how she treated me.i just think it’s fun,that’s all :D

Does ages really matters? i don’t know.Some people who have the same age as others just got lots of arguments while some people always sharing the same ideas and never feel like to have nothing to talk about.so,my answer is NOT!

Hopefully,i can prove it right.

okay,peace & stay tuned , again

love you guys<3
