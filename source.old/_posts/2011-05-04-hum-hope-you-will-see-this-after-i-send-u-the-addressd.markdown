hummm...

Once again, no long time no update.

but this time is special , because i just send this blog's address to a girl, a girl that i have crush on from 9.2010 to now. :D

ok, let's get started!

first of all, it's 4,may 2011 now. it's been a while and i think now i feel kinda ready to embrace the new opportunities and challenges . hopefully u can see me in Shanghai in next few days.Wish me luck!

I think i really did work hard in the past few week , i wrote a c library with some common data structure and algorithms and it can handle all data types.

and i make a little 'peer to peer'_chat tool named "talk2gals" , but now it can ONLY running on linux/unix Operating System now , because some portable issues. but it's not that hard to make it run on windows as long as i find the girl who's willing to use it to chat with me:D

I read so many books recently , i found them benefit me a lot ,i never felt i like reading book like this time before or let's just say before i get in university.i can freely read the book i like for my own good rather that for those suck exams.

i just found my english-writing skill is kinda decaying.

so i just put a SONG that i really really love to listing those days :

Play on , Sung by Carrie UnderWood from her album Play On.
