Classes is the only reliable guarantee that my blog will get updated so as i am in school.   
Now,just in less than 15 hours , Mr..sunus will be a 20-year-old guy and now he's under huge transforming.   
even thought i don't really what to write right now complain about teacher's continually showing off some English stuffs he's got. It sucks .   
Therefore, i am about to read a book borrowed last night , hoping i can bring something new on the table in the next few hours.   


........ 

It turned out did work as good as i expected , so i just keep writing in my un-variable-crappy style and i still you enjoy it.   
Fortunately , It's regular blog updating day as well as the last day of the 19 year old times , Which means there's no need to do a extra one of Birthday Special Edition that i planed to.   
But,To be honest, i didn't expect too much from my birthday , for almost getting nothing for several years and i am not sad about that anymore..As to the birthday celebration , I think , or , probably will become a feast of delicacies.then, go back to my dorm and do what i gotta do.   
Still I'd love to thanks all of my friend keeping me company , no matter how long it lasted or last ,no matter online friends or offline friends , or even you're currently taken, that's OK as well. And that's for sure i hope you guys will be with me forever.Because you guys are just as wonderful as i am:D and i do   
enjoy the time when we were together .yeah,One more thing i kind of look forward a special guest from Wuhan , Hubei. And you know what , she's an AIESECer!   
So,That's how it ends and hopefully something surprising happens:D   


HAPPY HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY TO SUNUS LEE !!!   
BEST OF LUCK IN THE FUTURE AS YOU ALWAYS GOT!!   
IN THE END , I STILL REMEMBER THE DAY WAS A PAINFUL DAY BACK IN .20 YEARS AGO. WHEN A GREAT MOTHER WAS TRYING EXTREMELY HRAD TO BRINGING ME TO THIS WORLD.   
THAT'S HOW I GOT THERE AND I LOVE YOU,MOM!NOW I HOPE I CAN MADE YOU PROUD OF ME!
