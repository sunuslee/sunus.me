i had some really really rough days lately and i think i kinda fucked up. i am not sure if i can still believe in what I've believed before.

i have really really high expectation for myself but that seems like going to become less possible , because of so many shit going on around this carpland.but, anyway, life moves on! just get some sleep and hang in there, u can make this happen even if this gets harder.
