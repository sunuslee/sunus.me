After several month's suffering,sunus is out of school as he wished and now he is on his way home,on the train.   
finally,i made up my mind to get out of school to put everything i got to what i love for years , it wasn't as tough as you thought . but it calls for courage and supports from all aspects to make it happen .luckily , i have them both ! so right now , it is my time to spark , to let the rest of the world know what i am doing and what exactly i am capable of . of course it is a long and tough way to go , but i firmly believe in myself as i always do . No matter how the world changes ,the future of mine is bright . so , i will just code my own future .  

I got off the train , and i will get in the plane shortly.:D 

so wish me luck!
