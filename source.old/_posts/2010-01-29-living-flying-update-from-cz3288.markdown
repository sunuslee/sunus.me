Now that i have successfully on board,and i don’t know since when i got this habit that do blog on the airplane.yep,last time i got to this place was five or six months ago,and i was kind of excited at that time.but now,all of those feeling were faded away and i don’t now why…

About the encounter stuffs,yeah,it was no bad , she looks good,but most importantly,maybe she’s elder enough to be my sister or something like that..what the HECK?! ,so i cut it  off and enjoy the rest of journey..

least confirmation : she’s 23,24 or something , a bit of old for me :<

i am kind of miss you,flymate:D
